     affected, Cygwin may be affected.  Certain URIs will bypass security
     and allow users to invoke or access any file depending on the system 
     configuration.  Without upgrading, a single .conf change will close 
     the vulnerability.  Add the following directive in the global server
     httpd.conf context before any other Alias or Redirect directives;
         RedirectMatch 400 "\\\.\."

  *) Accept multiple leading /'s for requests within the DocumentRoot.
     PR 10946  [William Rowe, David Shane Holden <dpejesh yahoo.com>]

  *) Solved the reports of .pdf byterange failures on Win32 alone.
     APR's sendfile for the win32 platform collapses header and trailer
     buffers into a single buffer.  However, we destroyed the pointers
     to the header buffer if a trailer buffer was present.  PR 10781

  *) When deciding on the default address family for listening sockets, 
     make sure we can actually bind to an AF_INET6 socket before
     deciding that we should default to AF_INET6.  This fixes a startup
     problem on certain levels of OpenUNIX.  PR 10235.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Replace usage of atol() to parse strings when we might want a
     larger-than-long value with apr_atoll(), which returns long long.
     This allows HTTPD to deal with larger files correctly.
     [Shantonu Sen <ssen apple.com>]

  *) mod_ext_filter: Ignore any content-type parameters when checking if
     the response should be filtered.  Previously, "intype=text/html"
     wouldn't match something like "text/html;charset=8859_1".
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) APR-Util Renames pending have been completed [Thom May]

  *) Performance improvements for the code that reads request
     headers (ap_rgetline_core() and related functions)  [Brian Pane]

  *) Add a new directive: MaxMemFree.  MaxMemFree makes it possible
     to configure the maximum amount of memory the allocators will
     hold on to for reuse.  Anything over the MaxMemFree threshold
     will be free()d.  This directive is useful when uncommon large
     peaks occur in memory usage.  It should _not_ be used to mask
     defective modules' memory use.  [Sander Striker]

  *) Fixed the Content-Length filter so that HTTP/1.0 requests to CGI
     scripts would not result in a truncated response.
     [Ryan Bloom, Justin Erenkrantz, Cliff Woolley]

  *) Add a filter_init parameter to the filter registration functions
     so that a filter can execute arbitrary code before the handlers
     are invoked.  This resolves a problem where mod_include requests
     would incorrectly return a 304.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a long-standing bug in 2.0, CGI scripts were being called
     with relative paths instead of absolute paths.  Apache 1.3 used
     absolute paths for everything except for SuExec, this brings back
     that standard.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix infinite loop due to two HTTP_IN filters being present for
     internally redirected requests.  PR 10146.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Switch conn_rec->keepalive to an enumeration rather than a bitfield.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix mod_ext_filter to look in the main server for filter definitions
     when running in a vhost if the filter definition is not found in
     the vhost.  PR 10147  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Support WinNT CGI invocation through ScriptInterpreterSource 
     'registry' for script interpreter paths and names with non-ascii
     characters in the executable filepath.  [William Rowe]

  *) Support the -w flag on to keep the Win32 console open on error.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Normalize the hostname value in the request_rec to all-lowercase
     [Perry Harrington <pedward webcom.com>]

  *) Fix WinNT cgi 500 errors when QUERY_ARGS or other strings include
     extended characters (non US-ASCII) in non-utf8 format.  This brings
     Win32 back into CGI/1.1 compliance, and leaves charset decoding up
     to the cgi application itself.  [William Rowe]

  *) Major overhaul of mod_dav, mod_dav_fs and the experimental/cache
     modules to bring them up to the current apr/apr-util APIs.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fix segfault in mod_mem_cache most frequently observed when
     serving the same file to multiple clients on an MP machine.

  *) Fix a silly htpasswd.c logic error that incorrectly reported that
     both -c and -n had been used.  PR 9989  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fixed a mod_include error case in which no HTTP response was sent
     to the client if an shtml document contained an unterminated SSI
     directive [Brian Pane]

  *) Improve ap_get_client_block implementation by using APR-util brigade
     helper functions and relying on current filter assumptions.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.39

  *) Fixed a build problem in htpasswd.c on Win32.
     [Guenter Knauf <eflash gmx.net>, Cliff Woolley]

Changes with Apache 2.0.38

  *) Rewrite htpasswd to use APR.  The removes the annoying warning about
     tmpnam being unsafe.   [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We must set the MIME-type for .shtml files to text/html if we want them
     to be parsed for SSI tags.  Add the config for that to the default 
     config file so that it is easier to enable .shtml parsing.
     [Dave Dyer <ddyer real-me.net>]

  *) Fixed a problem with 'make install' on ReliantUnix.
     [Jean-frederic Clere <jfrederic.clere fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Make the default_handler catch all requests that aren't served by
     another handler.  This also gets us to return a 404 if a directory
     is requested, there is no DirectoryIndex, and mod_autoindex isn't
     loaded.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fixed the handling of nested if-statements in shtml files.
     PR 9866  [Brian Pane]

  *) Allow 'make install DESTDIR=/path'.  This allows packagers to install
     into a directory different from the one that was configured.  This 
     also mirrors the root= feature from 1.3.  We cannot use prefix=,
     because both APR and APR-util resolve their installation paths at 
     configuration time.  This means that there is no variable prefix 
     to replace.  [Andreas Hasenack <andreas netbank.com.br>]

  *) AIX 4.3.2 and above: Define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
     These levels of AIX don't have a thundering herd problem with
     accept().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) prefork MPM: Ignore mutex errors during graceful restart.  For
     certain types of mutexes (particularly SysV semaphores), we
     should expect to occasionally fail to obtain or release the
     mutex during restart processing.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix install-bindist.sh so that it finds any perl instead of just
     early perl 5.x versions.  This is consistent with a build/install
     from source, and it allows the perl scripts installed by a bindist 
     to work on systems with perl 5.6.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix apxs so that the makefile created by "apxs -g" works on AIX and
     Tru64 (and probably some other platforms).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow CGI scripts to return their Content-Length.  This also fixes a
     hang on HEAD requests seen on certain platforms (such as FreeBSD).
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Added log rotation based on file size to the RotateLog support
     utility. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) 'SSLOptions +OptRengotiate' will use client cert in from the ssl
     session cache when there is no cert chain in the cache.  prior to
     the fix this situation would result in a FORBIDDEN response and
     error message "Cannot find peer certificate chain"

  *) Remove all special mod_ssl URIs.  This also fixes the bug where
     redirecting (.*) will allow an SSL protected page to be viewed
     without SSL.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the binary build install script so that the build logic
     created by "apxs -g" will work when the user has a binary
     build.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow instdso.sh to work with full paths to the shared module.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) NetWare: Enabled CGI functionality and added mod_cgi as a built
     in module for NetWare  [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Changed cgi and piped log behavior to accept 65536 characters

     client stdin, slurping the output from stdout and then the stderr
     stream.  PR 8179  [William Rowe]

  *) More efficient pool recycling logic for the worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) Modify the worker MPM to not accept() new connections until
     there is an available worker thread. This prevents queued

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2002-1592 (cve.mitre.org) [CERT VU#165803]
     Added the APLOG_TOCLIENT flag to ap_log_rerror() to
     explicitly tell the server that warning messages should be sent 
     to the client in addition to being recorded in the error log. 
     Prior to this change, ap_log_rerror() always sent warning 
     messages to the client. In one case, a faulty CGI script caused
     the server to send a warning message to the client that contained
     the full path to the CGI script. This could be considered a
     minor security exposure. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) mod_autoindex output when SuppressRules was specified would

     that it would actually get called. This fixes a core dump
     at init everytime you use the MMapFile directive. PR 8314
     [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Trigger an error when a LoadModule directive attempts to
     load a module which is built-in.  This is a common error when
     switching from a DSO build to a static build.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change instdso.sh to use libtool --install everywhere and then
     clean up some stray files and symlinks that libtool leaves around
     on some platforms.  This gets subversion building properly since
     it needed a re-link to be performed by libtool at install time,
     and the old instdso.sh logic to simply cp the DSO didn't handle
     that requirement.  [Sander Striker]

  *) Fix segfault in mod_mem_cache when garabge collecting an expired
     cache entry.  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Introduced -E startup_logfile_name option to httpd to allow admins
     to begin logging errors immediately.  This provides Win32 users 
     an alternative to sending startup errors to the event viewer, and
     allows other daemon tool authors an alternative to logging to stderr.

  *) Proxy was bombing out every second keepalive request, caused by a
     stray CRLF before the second response's status line. Proxy now
     tries to read one more line if it encounters a CRLF where it
     expected a status. PR 10010 [Graham Leggett]

  *) Deprecated the apr_lock.h API. Please see the following files

  *) worker, prefork, perchild, beos MPMs: Add -DFOREGROUND switch to 
     cause the Apache parent process to run in the foreground (similar to
     -DNO_DETACH except that it doesn't switch session ids).  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added support for Posix semaphore mutex locking (AcceptMutex posixsem)
     for those platforms that support it. If using the default
     implementation, this is between pthread and sysvsem in priority.
     This implies it's the new default for Darwin. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) AIX: Fix the syntax for setting the LDR_CNTRL and AIXTHREAD_SCOPE
     environment variables in the envvars file.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) worker MPM: Don't create a listener thread until we have a worker
     thread.  Otherwise, in situations where we'll have to wait a while
     to take over scoreboard slots from a previous generation, we'll be
     accepting connections we can't process yet.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The old, legacy (and unused) code in which the scoreboard was totally
     and completely contained in a file (SCOREBOARD_FILE) has been
     removed. This does not affect scoreboards which are *mapped* to
     files using named-shared-memory. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Change bucket brigades API to allow a "bucket allocator" to be
     passed in at certain points.  This allows us to implement freelists
     so that we can stop using malloc/free so frequently.

  *) add compat layer to support RSA SSLC 1.x and 2.x in mod_ssl
     [Jon Travis, John Barbee, William Rowe, Ryan Bloom, Doug MacEachern]

  *) Add a new parameter to the quick_handler hook to instruct
     quick handlers to optionally do a lookup rather than actually 
     serve content. This is the first of several changes required fix
     several problems with how quick handlers work with subrequests.

  *) When a proxied site was being served, Apache was replacing

     allowed by RFC2616. Fixed. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a mod_cgid problem that left daemon processes stranded
     in some server restart scenarios.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added exp_foo and rel_foo variables to config_vars.mk for
     all Apache and Autoconf path variables (like --sysconfdir,
     --sbindir, etc). exp_foo is the "expanded" version, which means
     that all internal variable references have been interpolated.
     rel_foo is the same as $exp_foo, only relative to $prefix if they
     share a common path.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix some restart/terminate problems in the worker MPM.  Don't
     drop connections during graceful restart.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the header merging behaviour in proxy, as some headers

  *) Fix a hang condition with graceful restart and prefork MPM
     in the situation where MaxClients is very high but

  *) New directive ProxyIOBufferSize. Sets the size of the buffer used
     when reading from a remote HTTP server in proxy. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Modify receive/send loop in proxy_http and proxy_ftp so that
     should it be necessary, the remote server socket is closed before
     transmitting the last buffer (set by ProxyIOBufferSize) to the
     client. This prevents the backend server from being forced to hang
     around while the last few bytes are transmitted to a slow client.
     Fix the case where no error checking was performed on the final
     brigade in the loop. [Graham Leggett]

      Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Rename the filter ordering priorities.  The recent filtering fixes
     have showcased problems with their usage.  Therefore, we need to
     rename them to increase the clarity.  (CONTENT->RESOURCE,
     HTTP_HEADER->CONTENT_SET/PROTOCOL)  [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.33

  *) Fix a problem in the new --enable-layout functionality where
     it wouldn't allow overrides from variables like --prefix,
     --bindir, etc.  [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Fix a bug in the core input filter for AP_MODE_EXHAUSTIVE. It
     no longer hangs around waiting for the socket to close before
     returning exhaustive data.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) rename apr_exploded_time_t to apr_time_exp_t (as per renames pending)
     [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>]

  *) Change mod_ssl to always do a full startup/teardown on restarts.
     this allows mod_ssl to be added to a server that is already
     running and makes it possible to add/change certs/keys after the
     server has been started.  [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Introduce PassPhraseDialog "|/path/to/pipe" mechanism to mod_ssl.
     This pipe must be a bidirectional 'console' style relay, which
     mod_ssl prints all prompts to the pipe's stdin, and reads the
     passphrases from the pipe's stdout.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix bug where --sysconfdir and --localstatedir were being
     ignored.  [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>, Aaron Bannert]
     PR 9888

  *) Fix --enable-layout to work again. Caution: When specifying
     --enable-layout, common arguments like --prefix, --exec-prefix,
     etc. will be ignored and the settings from the layout will be
     used instead.  [Thom May <thom planetarytramp.net>, Aaron Bannert]
     PR 9124, 9873, 9885

  *) New Directive for mod_proxy: ProxyRemoteMatch. This provides
     regex pattern matching for the determination of which requests
     to use the remote proxy for. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix CustomLog bytes-sent with HTTP 0.9.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Prevent Apache from ignoring SIGHUP due to some lingering 1.3
     cruft in piped logs and rewritemap child processes.
     [William Rowe]

  *) All instances of apr_lock_t have been removed and converted
     to one of the following new lock APIs: apr_thread_mutex.h,
     apr_proc_mutex.h, or apr_global_mutex.h. No new code should
     use the apr_lock.h API, as the old API will soon be deprecated.
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Merged in changes to mod_ssl up through 2.8.7-1.3.23.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall, Cliff Woolley]

  *) mod-include: make it handle flush'es and fix the 'false-alarm'
     [Justin Erenkrantz, Brian Pane, Ian Holsman]

  *) ap_get_*_filter_handle() functions to allow 3rd party modules
     to lookup filter handles so they can bypass the filter name
     lookup when adding filters to a request (via ap_add_*_filter_handle())
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Fix for multiple file buckets on Win32, where the first file
     bucket would cause the immediate closure of the socket on any
     non-keepalive requests.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Correct Win32 failure of mmap of a segment beyond start of the
     file; fixes large SSL and similar transfers.  [William Rowe]
     PR 9898

  *) Implement apr_proc_detach changes and allow -DNO_DETACH in the
     multi-process mode to not "daemonize" while detaching from the
     controlling terminal. This is necessary for Apache to work with
     process-management tools like AIX's "System Resource Controller"
     as well as Dan Bernstein's "daemontools".
     [Jos Backus <josb cncdsl.com>, Aaron Bannert]

  *) Convert mod_auth_digest to use the new apr_global_mutex_t
     type.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) fix bug in mod-include where it wouldn't send a unmatched
     part if it was at the end of a bucket [Ian Holsman]

  *) worker MPM: Improve logging of errors with the interface between
     the listener thread and worker threads.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Some browsers ignore cookies that have been merged into a
     single Set-Cookie header. Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers
     are now unmerged in the http proxy before being sent to the
     client. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a problem with proxy where each entry of a duplicated
     header such as Set-Cookie would overwrite and obliterate the
     previous value of the header, resulting in multiple header
     values (like cookies) going missing.
     [Graham Leggett, Joshua Slive]

  *) Add the server-limit and thread-limit values to the scoreboard
     for the sake of third-party applications.
     [Adam Sussman <myddryn vishnu.vidya.com>]

  *) Fix segfault when proxy recieves an invalid HTTP response [Ian Holsman]

  *) OS/390: Get make install to properly copy DSO modules.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Fix bug in mod_status with displaying "Restart Time"
     and "Server uptime".
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix IPv6 name-based virtual hosts.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Introduce AddOutputFilterByType directive.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix DEBUG_CGI support in mod_cgi.  PR 9670, 9671.
     [David MacKenzie <djm pix.net>]

  *) Fix incorrect check for script_in in mod_cgi.  PR 9669.
     [David MacKenzie <djm pix.net>]

  *) Fix segfault and display error when SSLMutex file can not be
     created.  [Adam Sussman <myddryn vishnu.vidya.com>]

  *) Add reference counting to mod_mem_cache cache objects to
     better manage removing objects from the cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change the verbage on the ScoreBoardFile in our default configs.
     Also change the default to be commented out (unspecified) so we
     get anonymous shared memory by default.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Implement new ScoreBoardFile directive logic. This affects how
     we create the scoreboard's shared memory segment. If the directive
     is present, a name-based segment is created. If the directive is
     not present, first an anonymous segment is created, and if that
     fails, a name-based segment is created from a file of the name
     DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD. This gives third-party applications the
     ability to access our scoreboard.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_deflate to work with non-GET requests and properly send
     Content-Lengths.  [Sander Striker <striker apache.org>]

  *) Fix ap_directory_merge() to correctly merge configs when there is
     no <Directory /> block.  [Justin Erenkrantz, William Rowe]

  *) Remove spurious debug messsages that are normal under HTTP
     keep-alive logic.  [Jeff Trawick, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a bug in mod_cgid that would prevent proper shutdown death
     of the cgid process.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Add signal handling back in to the worker MPM for the one_process
     (-X, -DDEBUG, -DONE_PROCESS) case.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Performance: Reuse per-connection transaction pools in the
     worker MPM, rather than destroying and recreating them.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Remove all signals from the worker MPM's child process.  Instead,
     the parent uses the Pipe of Death for all communication with the
     child processes.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.32

  *) mod_negotiation: ForceLanguagePriority now uses 'Prefer' as the
     default if the directive is not specified.  This mirrors older
     behavior without changes to the httpd.conf.  [William Rowe]

  *) Win32: solve the win32 service problems in 2.0.31-alpha, by fixing
     the service, mpm and logging code, and bugs in apr_file_open_stderr 
     and apr_file_dup2 functions.  Win2K/XP services have no handles 
     associated for stdin/out/err, which caused unpredictable behavior
     in the prior release.  [William Rowe, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: simplify the Application Event Log messages, since there isn't
     likely to be 'more information in the error log' before an error log
     has been opened.  [William Rowe]

  *) Win32: substantial cleanup to the mpm_winnt code for legibility and
     to follow the program flow of other MPMs.  [Ryan Bloom, William Rowe]

  *) Win32: apache -k shutdown now behaves like apache -k stop.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix prefork to not kill the parent if a child hits a resource shortage
     on accept().  [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix seg faults that occur when what should be the httpd request line
     starts with \r\n followed by garbage.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Allow statically linked support binaries with the new
     --enable-static-support flag, and enable this behavior in
     the binbuild script. Also add a new --enable-static-htdbm
     flag.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_autoindex to serve symlinks if permitted and attempt to
     do only one stat() call when generating the directory listings.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix resolve_symlink to save the original symlink name if known.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Be a bit more sane with regard to CanonicalNames.  If the user has
     specified they want to use the CanonicalName, but they have not
     configured a port with the ServerName, then use the same port that 
     the original request used. [Ryan Bloom and Ken Coar]

  *) In core_input_filter, check for an empty brigade after 
     APR_BRIGADE_NORMALIZE().  Otherwise, we can get segfaults if a
     client says it will post some data but we get FIN before any
     data arrives.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Not being able to bind to the socket is a fatal error.  We should
     print an error to the console, and return a non-zero status code.
     With these changes, all of the Unix MPMs do that correctly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) suexec: Allow HTTPS and SSL_* environment variables to be passed
     through to CGI scripts. PR 9163
     [Brian Reid <breid customlogic.com>, 
      Zvi Har'El <rl math.technion.ac.il>]

  *) binbuild.sh: Make sure that we use the expat from our source
     tree so that there aren't any surprises on the target machine.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgid: Add retry logic for when the daemon can't fork fast
     enough to keep up with new requests.  Start using 
     HTTP_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE instead of HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
     when we can't talk to the daemon.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apxs: LTFLAGS envvar can override default libtool options.  Try
     "LTFLAGS=' ' apxs -c mod_foo.c" to see what libtool does under
     the covers.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The Location: response header field, used for external
     redirect, *must* be an absoluteURI.  The Redirect directive
     tested for that, but RedirectMatch didn't -- it would allow
     almost anything through.  Now it will try to turn an abs_path
     into an absoluteURI, but it will correctly varf like Redirect
     if the final redirection target isn't an absoluteURI.  [Ken Coar]

Changes with Apache 2.0.31

  *) Create the scoreboard (in the parent) in a global pool context,
     so it survives graceful restarts. This fixes a SEGV during
     graceful restarts.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Add a timeout option to the proxy code 'ProxyTimeout' 
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) FTP directory listings are now always retrieved in ASCII mode.
     The FTP proxy properly escapes URI's and HTML in the generated
     listing, and escapes the path components when talking to the FTP
     server. It is now possible to browse the root directory by using
     a url like:   ftp://user@host/%2f/ (ported from apache_1.3.24)
     Also, the last path component may contain wildcard characters
     '*' and '?', and if they do, a directory listing is created instead
     of a file retrieval. Example: ftp://user@host/httpd/server/*.c
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Added single-listener unserialized accept support to the
     worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) New Directive for mod_proxy: 'ProxyPreserveHost'. This passes
     the incoming host header through to the proxied server
     [Geoff <g.russell ieee.org>]

  *) New Directive Option for ProxyPass. It now can block a location
     from being proxied [Jukka Pihl <jukka.pihl entirem.com>]

  *) Don't let the default handler try to serve a raw directory.  At
     best you get gibberish.  Much worse things can happen depending
     on the OS.  [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Change the pre_config hook to return a value. Modules can now emit
     an error message and then cause the server to quit gracefully during
     startup. This required a bump to the MMN.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix some unix socket descriptor leaks in the handler side of
     mod_cgid (the part that runs in the server process).  Whack a
     silly "close(-1)" in the handler too.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the pre_mpm hook to return a value, so that scoreboard
     init errors percolate up to code that knows how to exit 
     cleanly.  This required a bump to the MMN.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the socket back to the conn_rec and remove the create_connection
     hook. The create_connection hook had a design flaw that did not 
     allow creating connections based on vhost info. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fixed PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING from mod_negotiation results.
     Resolves the common case of using negotation to resolve the request
     /script/foo for /script.cgi/foo.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added new functions ap_add_(input|output)_filter_handle to
     allow modules to bypass the usual filter name lookup when
     adding hard-coded filters to a request [Brian Pane]

  *) caching should now work on subrequests (still very experimental)
     [Ian Holsman]
  
  *) The Win32 mpm_winnt now has a shared scoreboard.  [William Rowe]

  *) Change ap_get_brigade prototype to use apr_off_t instead of apr_off_t*.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Refactor ap_rgetline so that it does not use an internal brigade.
     Change ap_rgetline's prototype to return errors.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Remove mod_auth_db.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Do not install unnecessary pcre headers like config.h and internal.h.
     [Joe Orton <joe manyfish.co.uk>]

  *) Change in quick_hanlder behavior for subrequests. it now passes DONE
     (as it does for a normal request). quick_handled sub-requests now work
     in mod-include [Ian Holsman]

  *) Change SUBREQ_CORE so that it is a 'HTTP_HEADER' filter instead of
     'CONTENT' one, as it needs to run AFTER all content headers

  *) Rename BeOS MPM directive RequestsPerThread to MaxRequestsPerThread.
     [Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Split out blocking from the mode in the input filters.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_include.  [Justin Erenkrantz, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cause Win32 to capture all child-worker process errors in
     Apache to the main server error log, until the child can
     open its own error logs.  [William Rowe]

  *) HPUX 11.*: Do not kill the child process when accept() 
     returns ENOBUFS on HPUX 11.*. (ported from th 1.3 patch)
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a problem in the parsing of the <Proxy foo> directive.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) rewrite of mod_ssl input filter for better performance and less
     memory usage [Doug MacEachern]

  *) allow quick_handler to be run on subrequests. [Ian Holsman]

  *) mod_dav now asks its provider to place content directly into the
     filter stack when handling a GET request. The mod_dav/provider
     API has changed, so providers need to be updated. [Greg Stein]

  *) Clear the output socket descriptor in unixd_accept() to make sure
     we don't supply a bogus socket to the caller if the accept fails.
     This caused problems with the worker MPM, which tried to process
     the returned socket if it was non-NULL.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Move a check for an empty brigade to the start of core input filter
     to avoid segfaults.  [Justin Erenkrantz, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add FileETag directive to allow configurable control of what
     data are used to form ETag values for file-based URIs.  MMN
     bumped to 20020111 because of fields added to the end of
     the core_dir_config structure.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_rewrite's logging code caused by passing the
     wrong config to ap_get_remote_host().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow mod_cgid to work from a binary distribution install by
     using 755 for the permissions on the log directory instead of
     750.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fixed a segfault that happened during graceful shutdown (or when
     the httpd ran out of file descriptors) with the worker MPM [Brian Pane]

  *) Split all Win32 modules [excluding the core components mod_core, 
     mod_so, mod_win32 and the winnt mpm] into individual loadable
     modules, so the administrator may individually disable the former
     compiled-in modules by simply commenting out their LoadModule
     directives.  [William Rowe]

  *) Saved Win32 module authors and porters many future headaches, by
     duplicating the appropriate .h files such as os.h into the include
     directory, including in the build tree.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_ssl adjustments to help with using toolkits other than OpenSSL:
      Use SSL functions/macros instead of directly dereferencing SSL
      structures wherever possible.
      Add type-casts for the cases where functions return a generic pointer.
      Add $SSL/include to configure search path.
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>]

  *) Moved several pointers out of the shared Scoreboard so it is
     more portable, and will present the vhost name across server
     generation restarts.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix SSLPassPhraseDialog exec: and SSLRandomSeed exec:
     [Doug MacEachern]

Changes with Apache 2.0.30

  *) Fix the main bug for FreeBSD and threaded MPM's. There are
     still issues (see STATUS) but at least the server will now
     run without crashing the machine.
     [David Reid, Aaron Bannert, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a typo in mod_deflate's m4 config section.
     [albert chin <china thewrittenword.com>]

  *) Fix a couple of mod_proxy problems forwarding HTTP connections
     and handling CONNECT:
     (1) PR #9190  Proxy failed to connect to IPv6 hosts.
     (2) Proxy failed to connect when the first IP address returned by 
         the resolver was unreachable but a secondary IP address was.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix the module identifer as shown in the docs for various core
     modules (e.g., the identifer for mod_log_config was previously
     listed as config_log_module).  PR #9338
     [James Watson <ap2bug sowega.org>]

  *) Fix LimitRequestBody directive by placing it in the HTTP
     filter.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix mod_proxy seg fault when the proxied server returns 
     an HTTP/0.9 response or a bogus status line.
     [Adam Sussman]

  *) Prevent mod_proxy from truncating one character off the
     end of the status line returned from the proxied server.
     [Adam Sussman, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Eliminate loop in ap_proxy_string_read().
     [Adam Sussman, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Provide $0..$9 results from mod_include regex parsing.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Allow mod-include to look for alternate start & end tags [Ian Holsman]

  *) Introduced the ForceLanguagePriority directive, to prevent
     returning MULTIPLE_CHOICES or NONE_ACCEPTABLE in some cases,
     when using Multiviews.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a problem which prevented mod_cgid and suexec from working
     together reliably [Greg Ames]

  *) Remove the call to exit() from within mod_auth_digest's post_config
     phase.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a problem in mod_auth_digest that could potentially cause
     problems with initialized static data on a system that uses DSOs.
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a segfault in the worker MPM that could happen during
     child process exits.  [Brian Pane, Aaron Bannert]

  *) Allow mod_auth_dbm to handle multiple DBM types [Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix matching of vhosts by ip address so we find IPv4
     vhost address when target address is v4-mapped form of
     that address.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) More performance tweaks to the BNDM string-search algorithm
     used to find "<!--#" tokens in mod_include [Brian Pane]

  *) Miscellaneous small performance fixes: optimized away various
     string copy operations and removed large temp buffers from
     the stack [Brian Pane]

  *) Fixed startup segfault that occurred when a VirtualHost
     directive had a port but no address [Brian Pane]

  *) Allow htdbm to work with multiple DBM types [Ian Holsman]

  *) Win32: Made change to apr_sendfile() to return APR_ENOTIMPL
     if oslevel < WINNT.  This should fix several problems reported
     Against 2.0.28 on Windows 98 [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: Fix bug that could cause CGI scripts with QUERY_STRINGS
     to fail. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change core code to allow an MPM to set hard thread/server
     limits at startup.  prefork, worker, and perchild MPMs now have 
     directives to set these limits.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: The async AcceptEx() event should be autoreset upon
     successful completion of a wait (WaitForSingleObject). This
     eliminates a number of spurious
     setsockopt(SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT) failed." messages.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Move any load library path environment variables out of 
     apachectl and into a separate environment variable file which
     can be more easily tailored by the admin.  The environment
     variable file as built by Apache may have additional system-
     specific settings.  For example, on OS/390 we tailor the heap
     settings to allow lots of threads.  [Jeff Trawick]
    
  *) Use the new APR pool code to reduce pool-related lock
     contention in the worker MPM.  [Sander Striker]

  *) The POD no longer assumes the child is listening on 127.0.0.1
     and now pulls the first hostname in the list of listeners to
     perform the dummy connect on. This fixes a bug when the user
     had configured the Listen directive for an IP other than
     127.0.0.1. This would result in undead children and error
     messages such as "Connection refused: connect to listener".
     [Aaron Bannert]

  *) The worker MPM now respects the LockFile setting, needed to
     avoid locking problems with NFS.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix segfault when worker MPM receives SIGHUP.
     [Ian Holsman, Aaron Bannert, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix bug that could potentially prevent the perchild MPM from
     working with more than one vhost/uid.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Change make install and apxs -i processing of DSO modules to 
     perform special handling on platforms where libtool doesn't install 
     mod_foo.so.  This fixes some wonkiness on HP-UX, Tru64, and AIX 
     which prevented standard LoadModule statements from working.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Whenever mod_so is enabled (not just when there are DSOs for
     our modules), do whatever special magic is required for compiling/
     loading third-party modules.  This allows third-party DSOs to
     be used on an AIX build when there were no built-in modules
     built as DSOs.  (This should help on OS/390 and BeOS as well.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow apxs to be used to build DSOs on AIX without requiring the
     user to hard-code the list of import files.  (This should help
     on OS/390 and BeOS as well.)  [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Resolved segfault in mod_isapi when configuring with ISAPICacheFile.
     PR 8563, 8919  [William Rowe]
  
  *) Get binary builds working when libapr and libaprutil are built
     shared [Greg Ames]

  *) Get shared builds of libapr and libaprutil, as well as Apache DSOs,
     working on AIX.  [Aaron Bannert, Dick Dunbar <RLDunbar pacbell.net>,
     Gary Hook <ghook us.ibm.com>, Victor Orlikowski, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix the handling of SSI directives in which the ">" of the
     terminating "-->" is the last byte in a file [Brian Pane]

  *) Add back in the "suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: /path/to/suexec)"
     message that we had back in apache-1.3 and still have scattered
     throughout our docs.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Prevent the Win32 port from continuing after encountering an
     error in the command line args to apache.  [William Rowe]

  *) On a error in the proxy, make it write a line to the error log
     [Ian Holsman]

  *) Various mod_ssl performance improvements [Doug MacEachern]

Changes with Apache 2.0.29

  *) Add buffering in core_output_filter to ensure that long
     lists of small buckets don't cause small packet writes.
     [Brian Pane, Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the installation target to make sure that the manual is 
     installed in the correct location.
     [Yoshifumi Hiramatsu <hiramatu boreas.dti.ne.jp> and
      Gomez Henri <hgomez slib.fr>]

  *) Fix the cmd command for mod_include.  When we are processing
     a cmd command, we do not want to use the r->filename to set
     the command name.  The command comes from the SSI tag.  To do this,
     I added a variable to the function that builds the command line
     in mod_cgi.  This allows the include_cmd function to specify
     the command line itself. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change open_logs hook to return a value, allowing you
     to flag a error while opening logs
     [Ian Holsman, Doug MacEachern]

  *) Change post_config hook to return a value, allowing you
     to flag a error post config
     [Ian Holsman, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow SUEXEC_BIN (the path to the suexec binary that is
     hard-coded into the server) to be specified to the configure
     script by the --with-suexec-bin parameter.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix segv in worker MPM following accept on pipe-of-death
     [Brian Pane]

  *) Add mod_deflate to experimental.  
     [Ian Holsman, Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Bail out at configure time if an invalid MPM was specified.
     [jean-frederic clere <jfrederic.clere fujitsu-siemens.com>]

  *) Prevent segv in ap_note_basic_auth_failure() when no AuthName is
     configured [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]

  *) Fix apxs to use sbindir.  [Henri Gomez <hgomez slib.fr>]

  *) Fix a problem with IPv6 vhosts.  PR #8118  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Optimization for the BNDM string-search function in
     mod_include.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Fixed the behavior of the XBitHack directive.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>, Cliff Woolley] PR#8804

  *) The threaded MPM for Unix has been removed.  Use the worker
     MPM instead.  [various]

  *) APR-ize the resolver logic in mod_unique_id.  This fixes a bug
     in logging the error from a failed DNS lookup.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added the missing macros AP_INIT_TAKE13 and AP_INIT_TAKE123.
     [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Get mod_cgid killed when a MPM exits due to a fatal error.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a file descriptor leak in mod_include.  When we include a
     file, we use a sub-request, but we didn't destroy the sub-request
     immediately, instead we waited until the original request was
     done.  This patch closes the sub-request as soon as the data is
     done being generated.  [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Allow modules that add sockets to the ap_listeners list to
     define the function that should be used to accept on that
     socket.  Each MPM can define their own function to use for
     the accept function with the MPM_ACCEPT_FUNC macro.  This
     also abstracts out all of the Unix accept error handling
     logic, which has become out of synch across Unix MPMs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a bug which would cause the response headers to be omitted
     when sending a negotiated ErrorDocument because the required
     filters were attached to the wrong request_rec.
     [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]

  *) Remove commas from the end of the macros that define
     directives that are used by MPMs.  Prior to this patch,
     you would use these macros without commas, which was unlike
     the macros for any other directives.  Now, the caller provides
     the comma rather than the macro providing it.  This makes
     the macros look more like the rest of the directives.
     [Ryan Bloom and Cliff Woolley]

  *) Add 'redirect-carefully' environment option to disable sending
     redirects under special circumstances.  This is helpful for 
     Microsoft's WebFolders when accessing a directory resource via
     DAV methods.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Begin to abstract out the underlying transport layer.
     The first step is to remove the socket from the conn_rec,
     the server now lives in a context that is passed to the
     core's input and output filters. This forces us to be very
     careful when adding calls that use the socket directly,
     because the socket isn't available in most locations.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Really reset the MaxClients value in worker and threaded
     when the configured value is not a multiple of the number 
     of threads per child.  We said we did previously but we 
     forgot to. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add Debian layout.  [Daniel Stone <daniel sfarc.net>]

  *) If shared modules are requested and mod_so is not available,
     produce a fatal config-time error.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Improve http2env's performance by cutting the work it has to
     do.  [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) use new 'apr_hash_merge' function in mod_mime (performance fix)
     [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.28

  *) Fix infinite loop in mod_cgid.c.  
     [Dale Ghent <daleg elemental.org>, Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) When no port is given in a "ServerName host" directive, the
     server_rec->port is now set to zero, not 80. That allows for
     run-time deduction of the correct server port (depending on
     SSL/plain, and depending also on the current setting of
     UseCanonicalName). This change makes redirections
     work, even with https:// connections. As in Apache-1.3, the
     connection's actual port number is never used, only the ServerName
     setting or the client's Host: setting. Documentation updated
     to reflect the change. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add a '%{note-name}e' argument to mod-headers, which works in
     the same way as mod_log_confg.  [Ian Holsman]

  *) Fix the spelling of the AP_MPMQ_MIN_SPARE_DAEMONS and
     AP_MPMQ_MAX_REQUESTS_DAEMON macros in ap_mpm.h and all standard
     MPMs.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Introduce htdbm, a user management utility for db/dbm authorization
     databases.  [Mladen Turk <mturk mappingsoft.com>]

  *) Optimize usage of strlen and strcat in ap_directory_walk.
     [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.27

  *) Introduce an Apache mod_ssl initial configuration template 
     (ssl.conf, generated from ssl-std.conf).  [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed a memory leak in the getline parsing code that could
     be triggered by arbitrarily large header lines. Requests
     from the core input filter for single lines are now limited
     to HUGE_STRING_LEN (8192 bytes).  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a truncation bug in how we print the port on the Via: header. 
     The routine that prints the Via: header now takes a length for
     the port string.  [Zvi Har'El <rl math.technion.ac.il>]

  *) Some syntax errors in mod_mime_magic's magic file can result
     in a 500 error, which previously was unlogged.  Now we log the
     error.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the support/checkgid helper app, which checks the run-time
     validity of group identifiers usable in the Group directive.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Various --enable-so options have been fixed: --enable-so is
     treated as "static"; explicit --enable-so=shared issues an error;
     and explicit --enable-so fails with error on systems without
     APR_HAS_DSO.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Fix a segfault in the core input filter when the client socket
     gets disconnected unexpectedly.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fix the reporting for child processes that die.  This removes
     all of the non-portable W* macros from Apache. 
     [Jeff Trawick and Ryan Bloom]

  *) Win32: Track and display "Parent Server Generation:" in
     mod_status output. The generation will be bumped at
     server graceful restart, when the child process exits
     by hitting MaxRequestsPerChild or if the child 
     process exits abnormally. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32: Fix problem where MaxRequestsPerChild directive was
     not being picked up in favor of the default. Enable
     the parent to start up a new child process immediately upon
     the old child starting shutdown.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix some bungling of the remote port in rfc1413.c so that 
     IdentityCheck retrieves the proper user id instead of failing
     and thus always returning "nobody."  
     [Dick Streefland <Dick.Streefland xs4all.nl>]

  *) Introduced thread saftey for mod_rewrite's internal cache.
     [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Simplified mod_env's directives to behave as most directives are
     expected, in that UnsetEnv will not unset a SetEnv and PassEnv 
     directive following that UnsetEnv within the same container.
     Also provides a runtime startup warning if a PassEnv configured 
     environment value is undefined.  [William Rowe]

  *) The worker MPM is now completely ported to APR's new lock API. It
     uses native APR types for thread mutexes, cross-process mutexes,
     and condition variables.  [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Sync up documentation to remove all references to the now deprecated
     Port directive.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Moved all ldap modules from the core to httpd-ldap sub-project
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Exit when we can't listen on any of the configured ports.  This
     is the same behavior as 1.3, and it avoids having the MPMs to
     deal with bogus ap_listen_rec structures.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cleanup the proxy code that creates a request to the origin
     server.  This change adds an optional hook, which allows modules
     to gain control while the request is created if the proxy module
     is loaded.  The purpose of this hook is to allow modules to add
     input and/or output filters to the request to the origin.  While
     I was at it, I made the core use this hook, so that proxy request
     creation uses some of the code from the core.  This can still be
     greatly improved, but this is a good start.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.26

  *) Port the MaxClients changes from the worker MPM to the threaded
     MPM.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix mod_proxy so that it handles chunked transfer-encoding and works
     with the new input filtering system.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Introduce the MultiviewsMatch directive, to allow the operator
     to be flexible in recognizing Handlers and Filters filename
     extensions as part of the Multiviews matching logic, strict with
     MultiviewsMatch NegotiatedOnly to accept only filename extentions 
     that designate negotiated parameters, (content type, charset, etc.)
     or MultiviewsAll for the 1.3 behavior of matching any files, even
     if they have unregistered extensions.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fixed the configure script to add a LoadModule directive to
     the default httpd.conf for any module that was compiled
     as a DSO.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) rewrite mod_ssl input filtering to work with the new input filtering
     system.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) prefork: Don't segfault when we are able to listen on some but
     not all of the configured ports.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Build mod_so even if no core modules are built shared.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Introduce ap_directory_walk rewrite (with further optimizations
     required) to adapt to the ap_process_request_internal() changes.
     Optimized so subrequests and redirects now reuse previous section 
     merges, until we mismatch with the original directory_walk, and
     precomputed r->finfo results will cause directory_walk to skip
     the most expensive phases of the function.  [William Rowe]

  *) Allow ApacheMonitor to connect to and control Apache on other 
     WinNT/2K machines.   [Mladen Turk <mturk mappingsoft.com>]

  *) Remove the Port directive.  In it's place, the Listen directive
     is now a required directive, which tells Apache what port to
     listen on.  The ServerName directive has also been extended
     to accept an optional port.  If the port is specified to the
     ServerName, the server will report that port whenever it
     reports the port that it is listening on.  This change was
     made to ease configuration errors that stem from having a Port
     directive, and a Listen directive.  In that situation, the server
     would only listen to the port specified by the Listen command,
     which caused a lot of confusion to users.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Added mod_mime_magic, mod_unique_id and mod_vhost_alias to the Win32
     build, as loadable modules.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix --enable-mods-shared processing.  If most is specified,
     then all modules that can be compiled as shared modules are.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Update the mime.types file to map video/vnd.mpegurl to mxu
     and add commonly used audio/x-mpegurl for m3u extensions.        
     [Heiko Recktenwald <uzs106 uni-bonn.de>, Lars Eilebrecht]

  *) Eliminate the depreciated r->content_language, in favor of the array
     r->content_languages introduced many years ago.  Module authors must
     substantially overhaul their modules, so this needs to be upgraded
     if the module still relied on backwards-brokeness.  [William Rowe]

  *) Allow configure help strings to work with autoconf 2.50+ and 2.13.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Rewrite the input filtering mechanisms to consolidate and reorganize
     code.  In short, core_input_filter does something now and
     ap_http_filter is now only concerned with HTTP.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Update the Win32 build to re-absorb mod_proxy and family.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Resolved the build failure on Win32 using MSVC 5.0 (without the
     current SDK.)  [William Rowe]

  *) Some style changes to the code that does ProxyErrorOverride. Fixed
     config merge behaviour. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Allow support programs to be compiled against a static version
     of libapr.  This allows the smaller support programs to be 
     relocated.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Update the mime.types file to the registered media types as
     of 2001-09-25, and add mapping for xsl extension [Mark Cox]

  *) Fix MaxClients in the Worker MPM, so that it specifies the maximum
     number of clients that can connect at the same time, instead of
     specifying the maximum number of child processes.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Switch proc_pthread AcceptMutex configuration directive to pthread to 
     be consistent with 1.3.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Cache apr_explode_localtime() value for 15 seconds.
     [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Fix mod_include to not return ETag or Last-Modified headers.
     [Ian Holsman <ianh cnet.com>]

  *) Fix worker MPM's scoreboard logic.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Eliminate the wasteful run-time conversion of method names from strings 
     to numbers in places where the methods are known at compile time.  
     [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Turn the worker MPM's queue into a LIFO.  This may
     improve cache-hit performance under some conditions.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Switch back to SIGUSR1 for graceful restarts on all platforms that
     support it.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Cleanup the worker MPM.  We no longer re-use transaction
     pools.  This incurs less overhead than shuffling the pools
     around so that they can be re-used.  Remove one of the
     queue's condition variables.  We just redefined the API to
     state that you can't try to add more stuff than you allocated
     segments for.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Fix SSL VPATH builds [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]

  *) Fixed persistent connections when a request contains a body.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) mod_dav uses a new API to speak to the backend provider for dead
     property management. [Greg Stein]

  *) Remove the Win32 script-processing exception from mod_cgi, and
     roll build_command_line/build_argv_list into a unified, overrideable
     ap_cgi_build_command optional function.  [William Rowe]

  *) Rewrite find_start_sequence to use a better search algorithm
     to find the start tag.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix a seg fault in mod_include.  When we are generating an
     internal redirect, we must set r->uri to "", not a bogus
     string, and not NULL.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Optimized location_walk, so subrequests, redirects and second passes
     now reuse previous section merges on a <Location > by <Location >
     basis, until we mismatch with the original location_walk. 
     [William Rowe]

  *) Back out the 1.45 change to util_script.c.  This change made
     us set the environment variable REQUEST_URI to the redirected
     URI, instead of the originally requested URI.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Make mod_include do lazy evaluation of potentially expensive to
     compute variables.  [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Fix logging of bytes sent for HEAD requests.  %b and %B should
     log either - or 0, before this patch, they were both logging
     the file size.  [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Make mod_include check for BYTE_CHECK_THRESHOLD per bucket rather 
     than per character.  [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Normalize the primary request, redirects and sub-requests to
     run the same ap_process_request_internal for consistency in
     robustness, behavior and security.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a segfault with mod_include when r->path_info is not set
     (which is the case with mod_proxy).  [Ian Holsman <ianh cnet.com>]

  *) Add -X functionality back.  This indicates to all MPMs and any other
     part of Apache that it should run in "debug" mode.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Some initial support for the cygwin platform [prefork only].
     This is not to be confused with support for the WinNT/Win32
     platform, which is the recommended configuration for native
     Win32 users.  The cygwin platform support is recommended for
     cygwin platform users. [Stipe Tolj <tolj wapme-systems.de>]

  *) Changed syntax of Set{Input|Output}Filter.  The list of filters
     must be semicolon delimited (if more than one filter is given.)
     The Set{Input|Output}Filter directive now overrides a parent
     container's directive (e.g. SetInputFilter in <Directory /web/foo>
     will override any SetInputFilter directive in <Directory /web>.)
     This new syntax is more consistent with Add{Input|Output}Filter
     directives defined in mod_mime.  Also cures a bug in prior releases
     where the Set{Input|Output}Filter directive would corrupt the 
     global configuration if the multiple directives were nested.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Cured what's ailed mime for quite some time.  If an AddSomething
     was given in the configuration (Language, Charset, Handler or
     Encoding) Apache would set the content type as given by AddType, 
     but refused to check the mime.types file if AddType wasn't given 
     for that specific extension.  Setting the AddHandler for .html 
     without setting the AddType text/html html would cause Apache to 
     use the default content type.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added some bulletproofing to memory allocation in the LDAP cache
     code. [Graham Leggett]

Changes with Apache 2.0.25

  *) Move the installed /manual directory out of the /htdocs/ tree, so
     that it can be kept more independently from the remaining document
     root. The "Alias /manual ..." already allowed for easy projection
     into existing private document trees. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Add specified user attributes to the environment when using
     mod_auth_ldap. This allows you to use mod_include to embed specified
     user attributes in a page like so:
     Hello <!--#echo var="AUTHENTICATE_CN"-->, how are you?
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a performance problem with the worker MPM.  We now create
     transaction pools once, and re-use them for each connection.
     [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Modfied mod_mime to prevent mod_negotation from serving a multiview
     of a 'handler' or 'filter', so that any filename extension that does 
     not contribute to the negotiated metadata can't be served without
     an explicit request.  E.g., if the .Z extension is associated with
     an unzip filter, the user request somefile.Z.html, mod_negotiation
     won't serve it.  It can serve somefile.Z.html when somefile.Z is
     requested, since the .Z extension is explictly requested, if the
     .html extension is associated with ContentType text/html.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Introduce the AddInputFilter filter[;filter...] ext [ext...]
     and corresponding AddOutputFilter syntax, to insert one or more 
     filters by mod_mime filename extension processing.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a growing connection pool in core_output_filter() for 
     keepalive requests.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Moved split_and_pass_pretag_buckets back to being a
     macro at Ryans's request. Removed the return from it
     by setting and returning a return code instead. Updated
     the code to check the return code from the macro and
     do the right thing. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Fix a segfault when a numeric value was received for Host:.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add a function ap_remove_input_filter.  This is to match
     up with ap_remove_output_filter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Clean up location_walk, so that this step performs a minimum
     amount of redundant effort (it must be run twice, but it will no
     longer reparse all <Location > blocks when the request uri
     hadn't changed.)  [William Rowe]

  *) Eliminate proxy: (and all other 'special') processing from the
     ap_directory_walk() phase.  Modules that want to use special
     walk logic should refer to the mod_proxy map_to_location example,
     with it's proxy_walk and proxysection implementation.  This makes
     either directory_walk flavor much more legible, since that phase
     only runs against real <Directory > blocks.
     [William Rowe]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a security problem in mod_include which would allow
     an SSI document to be passed to the client unparsed.
     [Cliff Woolley, Brian Pane]

  *) Introduce the map_to_storage hook, which allows modules to bypass
     the directory_walk and file_walk for non-file requests.  TRACE
     shortcut moved to http_protocol.c as APR_HOOK_MIDDLE, and the
     directory_walk/file_walk happen as APR_HOOK_VERY_LAST in core.c.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add the ability for mod_include to add the INCLUDES filter
     if the file is configured for the server-parsed handler.
     This makes the configuration for .shtml files much easier
     to understand, and allows mod_include to honor Apache 1.3
     config files.   Based on Doug MacEachern's patch to PHP
     to do the same thing.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) force OpenSSL to ignore process local-caching and to always
     get/set/delete sessions using mod_ssl's callbacks
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>,
      Geoff Thorpe <geoff geoffthorpe.net>]

  *) Make the worker MPM shutdown and restart cleanly.  This also
     cleans up some race conditions, and gets the worker using
     pools more cleanly.  [Aaron Bannert <aaron clove.org>]

  *) Implement CRYPTO_set_locking_callback() in terms of apr_lock
     for mod_ssl
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>]

  *) Fix for mod_include. Ryan's patch to check error
     codes put a return in the wrong place. Also, the
     include handler return code wasn't being checked.
     I don't like macros with returns, so I converted
     SPLIT_AND_PASS_PRETAG_BUCKETS into a function.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) fix segv in mod_mime if no AddTypes are configured
     [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]

  *) Enable ssl client authentication at SSL_accept time
     [Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_include when the original request has no
     associated filename (e.g., we're filtering the error document for
     a bad URI).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a storage leak (a strdup() call) in mod_mime_magic.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The prefork and OS/2 MPMs are overwriting the pid file when a second copy
     of httpd is started and shuts down due to socket conflict. Moving the
     call to ap_log_pid solves the problem.

  *) Changed the late-1.3 log_config substitution %c to %X, to log the
     status of the closed connection, as it conflicts with the far more
     common, historical ssl logging directive %...{var}c.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added the common error/ tree to the build/install targets 
     (similar to the common icons/ tree) for the multi-language error 
     messages that Lars committed earlier.  [William Rowe]

  *) Added a multi process, multi threaded OS/2 MPM mpmt_os2.  [Brian Havard]

  *) Added a default commented-out mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap
     configuration to httpd-std.conf and httpd-win.conf
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Added documentation for mod_ldap and mod_auth_ldap.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Enabled negative caching on attribute comparisons in the LDAP cache.
     Fixed a problem where the default cache TTL was set in milliseconds
     not microseconds causing the cache to time out almost immediately.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fixed all the #if APR_HAS_SHARED_MEMORY checks within the LDAP
     module code to follow APR. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fixed LDAP cleanup on graceful restarts. LDAP connections are now
     cleaned up when the connection pool pool is cleaned up.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix a minor issue with Jeff Trawick's mod_include
     patch. Without this patch, the code will just allocate
     more bytes in get_combined_directive than are needed.
     [Paul Reder]

  *) Added the LDAP authentication module mod_auth_ldap.
     [Dave Carrigan <dave rudedog.org>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Added the LDAP cache and connection pooling module mod_ldap.
     [Dave Carrigan <dave rudedog.org>, Graham Leggett]

  *) Fix --enable-modules=all breakage with mod_auth_db and mod_auth_digest
     by allowing a module to disable itself if its prerequisites are not
     met.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

Changes with Apache 2.0.24

  *) Fix a couple of issues in mod_include when the tag appeared at
     offsets near 8192 in the file being parsed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix an assertion failure in mod_ssl when the keepalive timeout is  
     reached.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Numerous improvements to the Win32 build system.  Introduced command line
     builds without requiring .mak files for MSVC 6.0 and later versions.
     Improved .dsp file compatibility for both Visual Studio 5.0 and 6.0 users.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Assorted corrections and improvements to the winnt_mpm startup code.  Better
     reporting of uninstalled services and other error conditions, and changed the 
     default service name to Apache2.  [William Rowe]

  *) Numerous improvements to the Win32 ApacheMonitor utility, including winnt_mpm 
     compatibility with existing Apache 1.3 Win32 Apache management utilites.  
     [Mladen Turk <mturk mappingsoft.com>, William Rowe]

  *) Fixed the segfaults in mod_mime introduced by hash tables in 2.0.20.
     [William Rowe, Greg Ames]

  *) Rounded out the mod_mime Add/Remove pairs by adding RemoveLanguage
     and RemoveCharset directives.  [William Rowe]

  *) The Unix MPMs other than perchild now allow child server 
     processes to use the accept mutex when starting as root and 
     using SysV sems for the accept mutex.  Previously, this 
     combination would lead to fatal errors in the child server 
     processes.  perchild can't use SysV sems because of security
     issues.  [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Added Win32 revision stamp resources to all http binaries
     (including modules/ and support/ tools.)  PR7322  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix ap_rvprintf to support more than 4K of data at one time.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]

  *) We have always used the obsolete/deprecated Netscape syntax
     for our tracking cookies; now the CookieStyle directive
     allows the Webmaster to choose the Netscape, RFC2109, or
     RFC2965 format.  The new CookieDomain directive allows the
     setting of the cookie's Domain= attribute, too.  PR #s 5006,
     5023, 5920, 6140 [Ken Coar]

  *) Tweak server/Makefile so that the rules for generating exports.c
     are compatible with make utilities which don't expand wildcards
     in a dependency list (e.g., OS/390 make, certain levels of GNU
     make).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Install the SSL headers.  [John Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]

  *) Begin to sanitize the MPM configuration directives.  Now, all
     MPMs use the same functions for all common MPM directives.  This
     should make it easier to catch all bugs in these directives once.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]

  *) Close a major resource leak.  Every time we had issued a
     graceful restart, we leaked a socket descriptor.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a problem with the new method code.  We need to cast
     the 1 to an apr_int64_t or it will be treated as a 32-bit
     integer, and it will wrap after being shifted 32 times.
     [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net> and Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Fix a bug in mod_expires.  Previous to this patch, if you
     told mod_expires to add 604800 seconds to the last-modified
     time, it actually added 604800 usec's to the last-modified time,
     so that when looking at the response it looked like nothing
     had been done.  The root of the problem was that we always compute
     time in usec's, but we ask users to input sec's.  This means we
     need to convert to usec's before using those values.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) The worker MPM now handles shutdown and restart requests.  It
     definitely isn't perfect, but we do stop the servers correctly.
     The biggest problem right now is that SIGHUP causes the server to
     just die.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.23

  *) Use the prefork MPM by default on Unix.  [various]

  *) Added a systray icon monitor application for Win32.
     [Mladen Turk <mturk mappingsoft.com>]

  *) mod_rewrite: Fix the line ending on some non-Unix systems for 
     messages written to the rewrite log.  
     [Richard Labennett <rlabenn us.ibm.com>]

  *) All mod_autoindex query parsing is now quietly quashed with the 
     IndexOption IgnoreClient.  The IndexOption SuppressColumnSorting 
     still drops the column sort <a href>'s for the column headers, but 
     IgnoreClient is required to ignore these Query options entirely.  
     [William Rowe]

  *) Introduced new mod_autoindex query argument parsing for F=[0|1|2]
     to allow the client to select plain, FancyIndexing or HTMLTable
     formatting, V=[0|1] to inhibit or enable version sorting, and 
     P=pattern to return only specific files.  The old Query Arguments
     were reorganized as C=f for sorting column 'f' (same N, D, S, or M
     as before), and O=A|D for ordering ascending or descending.  
     [William Rowe]

  *) Fixed an error in mod_include's directive parsing routines which
     caused #if, #elif, and #else expressions containing backslashes
     to be improperly evaluated.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Introduced new mod_autoindex IndexOptions flags: SuppressIcon to 
     drop the icon column, SuppressRules to drop the <hr> elements, 
     and HTMLTable to create rudimentary HTML table listings (implies 
     FancyIndexing).  [William Rowe]

  *) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag TrackModified
     from Apache 1.3.15.  This is needed for two reasons, first, given
     multiple machines within a server farm, ETags and Last-Modified 
     stamps won't correspond from machine to machine, and second, many 
     Unixes don't capture changes to the date or time stamp of existing 
     files, since these don't modify the dirent itself.  [William Rowe]

  *) Re-introduced the mod_autoindex IndexOptions flag FoldersFirst 
     and DirectoryWidth options from Apache 1.3.10. 
     [William Rowe, Ken Coar]

  *) Eliminated FancyIndexing directive, deprecated early in Apache
     1.3 by the IndexOptions FancyIndexing syntax.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_autoindex now excludes any file names that would result in
     an error, other than a success or redirect.  Also optimized
     the parent directory, always included except in the URI '/'.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Refactored mod_negotiation and mod_mime to help mod_dir accept
     negotiated index pages, and prevent the server from defaulting
     to an autoindex of the directory.  mod_negotiation will now die
     with a 500 Internal Error if it could match some filenames 
     (e.g. for mod_dir) but none can be served.  mod_negotation now
     refuses to serve any file with an extention that mod_mime doesn't
     recognize, and wasn't part of the request.  [William Rowe]

  *) Eliminate mod_cgi's handling of .exe files without the .exe file
     extension.  This is already handled by multiviews, if the admin
     wishes to AddHandler .exe or define a content type handler and 
     associate .exe files with that content type.  Multiviews must be
     enabled to allow these to be served.  [William Rowe]

  *) Speed up the server's response to a spike in incoming workload
     or restarts by assigning empty scoreboard slots to new processes
     when they are available.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Add a handler to mod_includes.c.  This handler is designed to
     implement the XbitHack directive.  This can't be done with a
     fixup, because we need to check the content-type, which is
     only available in the handler phase.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the includes filter check return codes from filters lower in
     the filter chain.  If a lower level filter returns an error, then
     the request needs to stop immediately.  This allows mod_include to
     stop parsing data once a lower filter recognizes an error.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add the ability to extend the methods that Apache understands
     and have those methods <limit>able in the httpd.conf. It uses 
     the same bit mask/shifted offset as the original HTTP methods 
     such as M_GET or M_POST, but expands the total bits from an int to 
     an ap_int64_t to handle more bits for new request methods than 
     an int provides.  [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]

  *) Fix broken mod_mime behavior in merging its arguments.  Possible
     cause of unexplicable crashes introduced in 2.0.20.  [William Rowe]

  *) Solve many mod_ssl porting issues (too many to detail) with 
     help from the whole team, but most notably [Ralf S. Engelschall, 
     Madhusudan Mathihalli <madhusudan_mathihalli hp.com>, 
     Doug MacEachern, William Rowe, Cliff Woolley]

  *) More stall fixes for the threaded & worker mpm's.
     Make mod_status output more accurate.  Don't
     count workers in processes which aren't actively
     serving requests. [Greg Ames]
     
  *) Win32: Get SSI exec cgi tag working. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add a single listener/multiple worker MPM.  This MPM is
     definately not fully correct, but it allows us to solve many
     of the problems that exist in the threaded MPM.  This is a 
     modified version of the threaded MPM.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Improve content generation throughout Apache, providing closer
     compliance with HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0
     Transitional specifications.  [William Rowe]

Changes with Apache 2.0.22
  
  *) Fix a problem where the threaded MPM stalls after restarts or
     segfaults.  Also prevent multiple active processes from using
     the same scoreboard slot.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Apache/Win32 now fills in the service description with Apache's
     server version string, including loaded and advertised modules.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Improved support for the Win32 build, to recover gracefully from
     missing apr or apr-util directories or the awk interpreter, 
     create the proper cgi-bin examples, including a test-cgi.bat, and 
     fix the perl shebang line for printenv.pl, when installing from 
     the build environment.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix a segfault in threaded.c caused by passing uninitialized
     apr_thread_t * to apr_thread_join().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Use new APR number conversion functions to reduce CPU consumption 
     when setting the content length, and in mod_log_config.
     [Brian Pane]
     
  *) Fix problem reported by Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>
     where HEAD response headers were being repeated twice for
     files greater than 32K bytes (4*AP_MIN_BYTES_TO_WRITE). This
     problem in the http_header filter was exposed by the recent rewrite
     of the content_length filter. [Taketo Kabe, Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix seg faults in mod_status with ExtendedStatus enabled, after
     restarts.  A garbage pointer to a vhost's server_rec from the
     previous generation was being left around under certain
     conditions. [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix a cosmetic problem with mod_include.  Non-existant SSI vars
     used to appear as '(none', without the closing paren.
     [Günter Knauf <eflash gmx.net>]

  *) Improve the exports generating awk script.  In the past, we had
     work around problems in the awk script by avoiding some #if and
     #ifdefs.  This has bitten us many times in generating the exports.c
     file.  This improvement allows corrects the header file parsing.
     [Sander Striker <striker apache.org>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.21

  *) Resolve the Win32 htpasswd bug, where a file that existed would be
     overwritten, regardless of the -c flag.
     [William Rowe, Mladen Turk <mladen.turk mail.inet.hr>]

  *) Introduce connection sub-pools into ab.  Truncating the lifetime
     of these allocations means that ab no longer perpetually grows
     its working set, running out of memory on large request attempts.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make scoreboard creation a hook.  This allows management
     modules to have access to the scoreboard at the time that it is
     created, and at every restart request.  
     [Cody Sherr <csherr covalent.net>]

  *) Changed AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMONS to refer to MaxClients and
     added an AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMON_USED to refer to the highest
     daemon index actually used in the scoreboard. I also
     updated the pertinent calls. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Win32: Prevent listening sockets from being inherited by
     the Apache child process, CGI scripts, rotatelog process
     etc.  If the Apache child process segfaults, any processes 
     that the child started are not reaped. Prior to this fix,
     these processes inherited the listening sockets which sometimes
     prevented the restarted Apache child process from accepting
     connections (ie, the server would hang). 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Provide vhost and request strings when ExtendedStatus is on.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix some issues with the pod and prefork: check the pod *after*
     processing a connection so that a server processing a time-
     consuming request bails out as soon as practical; when the
     parent process wakes up a server process via connect(), use an
     APR timeout on the connect() so that we don't hang for a long
     time if there aren't server processes around to do accept().
     [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Performance improvement to mod_mime.c. find_ct() in mod_mime, 
     spends a lot of time in apr_table_get calls.  Using the default 
     httpd.conf, the tables for languages and charsets are somewhat
     large, so the time spent scanning them on each request is
     significant. Replacing the tables with hash tables provides
     a nice speedup. [Brian Pane <bpane pacbell.net>]

  *) Add two functions to allow modules to access random parts of the
     scoreboard.  This allows modules compiled for one MPM to access the
     scoreboard, even if it the server was compiled for another MPM.
     [Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie covalent.net>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.20

  *) Fix problem in content-length filter where the filter would
     buffer all the output from a CGI before sending any bytes
     down the filter stack to the network. This problem would cause
     significant memory consumption if the CGIs generated
     lots of bytes. [Bill Stoddard]
  
  *) Get non-blocking CGI pipe reads working with the bucket brigades.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix seg fault on Windows when serving files cached with mod_file_cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a bug in the threaded MPM that would cause it to kill off all
     workers immediately after starting if the number of workers started
     was above a certain threshold.  [Ryan Bloom, Bill Stoddard]

Changes with Apache 2.0.19

  *) Fix problem with threaded MPM.  The problem was that if each child
     process was busy serving a single long-lived request and the server
     was sent a graceful restart signal, the server would stop serving
     requests.  This would happen because each child process would wait to
     die until the last thread was done, and the parent wouldn't spawn any
     new children until a process died.  Now, the parent looks at the fact
     that the children are dying gracefully, and starts new children.
     Those new children only start enough threads to compliment the number
     of threads in the other child process that shares the same spot in
     the scoreboard.  In this way, we make sure to never go over
     MaxClients.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) modified mod_negotiation and mod_autoindex to speed up by almost a
     factor of two on apr_dir_read()-enhanced platforms, such as Win32
     and OS2, by calling ap_sub_request_lookup_dirent() with the results
     already provided by apr_dir_read().  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_file_cache is now more robust to filtering and serves requests
     slightly more efficiently.  [Cliff Woolley]

  *) Fix problem handling FLUSH bucket in the chunked encoding filter.
     Module was calling ap_rwrite() followed by ap_rflush() but the 
     served content was not being displayed in the browser. Inspection
     of the output stream revealed that the first data chunk was
     missing the trailing CRLF required by the RFC.  [Bill Stoddard]

  *) apxs no longer generates ap_send_http_header() in the example handler

  *) Fix an ab problem which could cause a divide-by-zero exception
     with certain invocations (e.g., ab -k -c 6 -n 100 localhost/).
     [Ian Holsman <ianh cnet.com>]

  *) Solve case-insensitive platforms' confusion about negotiated
     filenames, allowing files of differnt case to match in choosing
     the document to serve.  [William Rowe]

  *) Fix brokenness when ThreadsPerChild is higher than the built-in
     limit.  We left ap_threads_per_child at the higher value which
     led to segfaults when doing certain scoreboard operations.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix seg faults and/or missing output from mod_include.  The
     default_handler was using the subrequest pool for files and
     MMAPs, even though the associated APR structures typically 
     live longer than the subrequest. [Greg Ames]
  
  *) Extend mod_setenvif to support specifying regular expressions
     on the SetEnvIf (and SetEnvIfNoCase) directive attribute field.
     Example:  SetEnvIf ^TS*  [a-z].* HAVE_TS 
     will cause HAVE_TS to be set if any of the request headers begins 
     with "TS" and has a value that begins with any character in the
     set [a-z]. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) httpd children now re-bind themselves to a random CPU on
     multiprocessor systems on AIX via bindprocessor() in 2.0.
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Fix htdigest. It would go into a loop in getline when adding 
     a second user. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Win32 platforms now fully support mod_userdir options.  [Will Rowe]

  *) Automatically generate httpd.exp for AIX.
     DSOs now work again on AIX in 2.0
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Add a new request hook, error_log.  This phase allows modules
     to act on the error log string _after_ it has been written
     to the error log.  The goal for this hook is to allow monitoring
     modules to send the error string to the monitoring agent.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Modify mod_echo to make it use filters for input and output.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Extend mod_headers to support conditional driven Header 
     add, append and set. Use SetEnvIf to set an envar and conditionally
     add/append/set headers based on this envar thusly:

     SetEnvIf TSMyHeader value HAVE_TSMyHeader
     Header add MyHeader "%t %D" env=HAVE_TSMyHeader

     If the request contains header "TSMyHeader: value" then header
     MyHeader: "t=xxxxxxxxxx D=yyyy" will be sent on the response.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Extend mod_headers to support using format specifiers on Header
     add, append and set header values. Two format specifiers are supported:

     %t - reports, in UTC microseconds since the epoch, when the
          request was received.

     %D - reports the time, in microseconds, between when the request was 
          received and the response sent. 

     Examples:
     Header add MyHeader "This request served in %D microseconds. %t"

     results in a header being added to the response that looks like this:
     
     MyHeader: This request served in D=5438 microseconds. t=991424704447256

     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix reset_filter().  We need to be careful how we remove filters.
     If we set r->output_filters to NULL, we also have to reset the
     connection's filters.  [John Sterling]

  *) Optimise reset_filter() in http_protocol.c. [Greg Stein]

  *) Add a check to ap_die() to make sure the filter stack is sane and
     contains the correct basic filters when an error occurs. This fixes
     a problem where headers are not being sent on error. [John Sterling]

  *) New Header directive 'echo' option. "Header echo regex" will
     cause any headers received on the request that match regex to be
     echoed to (included in) the response headers.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) include/ap_compat.h tested and set APR_COMPAT_H instead of AP_COMPAT_H.
     This prevented the inclusion of apr_compat.h.  PR #7773
     [Oleg Broytmann <phd phd.pp.ru>]

  *) Moved util_uri to the apr-util library.  This required a bunch of
     apr_name changes for the uri utility functions.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Move the addition of default AP_HTTP_HTTP_HEADER filters to the
     insert_filter phase so that other filters are not bypassed by default.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Reimplement mod_headers as an output filter. mod_headers can now
     add custom headers to inbound requests using the RequestHeader directive
     and to responses using the same old Header directive.  [Graham Leggett]

Changes with Apache 2.0.18

  *) Fix command-line processing so that if a bad argument is specified
     Apache will exit.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the make targets and rules to be consistent in all of the
     Apache-owned source trees.  [Roy Fielding]
     
  *) Fix processing of the TRACE method.  Previously we passed bogus
     parms to form_header_field() and it overlaid some vhost structures,
     resulting in a segfault in check_hostalias(). 
     [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Add support for reliable piped logs. If the logging process
     goes down, Apache will automatically restart it. This function has 
     been part of Apache on Unix/Linux/BSD since the early v1.3 releases.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Do not start piped log processes during the config file 
     preflight.  This change also circumvents a problem on 
     Windows where the rotatelog processes created during preflight
     was not getting cleaned up properly.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) add "Request Phase Participation" info to mod_info
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Make first phase changes to the scoreboard data structures in
     preparation for the rewriting of the scoreboard per my posted
     design notes. [Paul J. Reder]

  *) Fix httpd's definition of LTFLAGS to be consistent with that of apr
     and apr-util, allow it to be overridden by the configure command-line
     (default="--silent") and introduce LT_LDFLAGS to replace what we were
     formerly abusing as LTFLAGS.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Clean up the reporting of incorrect closing container tags.

  *) Create Files, and thus MMAPs, out of the request pool, not the
     connection pool.  This solves a small resource leak that had us
     not closing files until a connection was closed.  In order to do
     this, at the end of the core_output_filter, we loop through the
     brigade and convert any data we have into a single HEAP bucket
     that we know will survive clearing the request_rec.

  *) Completely revamp configure so that it preserves the standard make
     variables CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS by moving
     the configure additions to EXTRA_* variables.  Also, allow the user
     to specify NOTEST_* values for all of the above, which eliminates the
     need for THREAD_CPPFLAGS, THREAD_CFLAGS, and OPTIM.  Fix the setting
     of INCLUDES and EXTRA_INCLUDES.  Check flags as they are added to
     avoid pointless duplications.  Fix the order in which flags are given
     on the compile and link lines.  Remove obsolete macros APR_DOEXTRA,
     AC_ADD_LIBRARY, AC_CHECK_DEFINE, APACHE_PASSTHRU, and APACHE_ONCE.
     Added APR_SAVE_THE_ENVIRONMENT and APR_RESTORE_THE_ENVIRONMENT macros.

  *) Removed the keptalive boolean from conn_rec because it is now only
     used by a single routine and can be replaced by a local variable.
     [Greg Stein, Ryan Bloom, Roy Fielding]

  *) Patch prefork to put enough of the signal processing back in so that
     signals are all handled properly now. The previous patch fixed the
     deadlock race condition, but broke the user directed signal handling.
     This fixes it to work the way it did before my previous prefork patch
     (primarily, SIGTERM is now working).
 
  *) Change how input filters decide how much data is returned to the
     higher filter.  We used to use a field in the conn_rec, with this
     change, we use an argument to ap_get_brigade to determine how much
     data is retrieved. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix seg fault at start-up introduced by Ryan's change to enable
     modules to specify their own logging tags. mod_log_config
     registers an optional function, ap_register_log_handler().
     ap_register_log_handler() was being called by http_core before
     the directive hash table was created. This patch creates the
     directive hash table before ap_register_log_handler() is
     registered as an optional function.

  *) Allow modules to specify their own logging tags.  This basically
     allows a module to tell mod_log_config that when %x is encountered
     a specific function should be called.  Currently, x can be any single
     character.  It may be more useful to make this a string at some point.

Changes with Apache 2.0.17

  *) If a higher-level filter handles the byterange aspects of a
     request, then the byterange filter should not try to redo the
     work.  The most common case of this happening, is a byterange
     request going through the proxy, and the origin server handles
     the byterange request.  The proxy should ignore it.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin sharp.fm>]

  *) Changed the threaded mpm to have child_main join to each of the
     worker threads to make sure the kids are all gone before child_main
     exits after a signal (cleanup from perform_idle_server_maintenance).
     This is an extension of Ryans recent commit to make the child_main
     the signal thread.

  *) Add more options to the ap_mpm_query function.  This also allows MPMs to
     report if their threads are dynamic or static.  Finally, this also
     implements a new API, ap_show_mpm, which returns the MPM that was
     required into the core. [Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie covalent.net>]

  *) Do not install the binaries from the support directory twice.

  *) Remove BindAddress from the default config file.
     [<giles nemeton.com.au>]

  *) Allow module authors to add a module to their Apache build using
     --with-module, without re-running buildconf.  The syntax is:
         --with-module=module_type:/path/to/module.c
     The configure script will copy the module.c file to 
     modules/module_type, and it will be added to the relevant Makefiles.
     currently, this only works for static modules.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Changes required to make prefork clean up idle children properly.
     There was a window during which a starting worker deadlocks when
     an idle cleanup arrives before it completes init. Apache then keeps
     trying to cleanup the same deadlocked worker forever (until higher
     pids come along, but it still will never reduce below the deadlocked
     pid). Thus the number of children would not reduce to the correct
     idle level. [Paul J. Reder]

Changes with Apache 2.0.16

  *) Change the default installation directory to /usr/local/apache2,

     "<Directory>" followed by "</Directory" and
     "<Directory>" followed by "</Directoryz>".  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Cleanup the --enable-layout option of configure.  This makes
     us use a consistent location for the config.layout file, and it
     makes configure more portable.

  *) Changes to 'ab'; fixed int overrun's, added statistics, output in
     csv/gnuplot format, rudimentary ssl support and various other tweaks
     to make results more true to what is measured. The upshot of this it
     turns out that 'ab' has often underreported the true performance of
     apache. Often by a order of magnitude :-) See talk/paper of Sander 
     Temme at April ApacheCon 2001 for details.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Clean up mod_cgid's temporary request pool.  Besides fixing a
     storage leak this ensures that some unnecessary pipes are closed.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Performance: Add quick_handler hook. This hook is called at the
     very beginning of the request processing before location_walk,
     translate_name, etc.  This hook is useful for URI keyed content
     caches like Mike Abbott's Quick Shortcut Cache.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) top_module global variable renamed to ap_top_module [Perl]

  *) Move ap_set_last_modified to the core.  This is a potentially 
     controversial change, because this is kind of HTTP specific.  However
     many protocols should be able to take advantage of this kind of
     information.  I expect that headers will need one more layer of
     indirection for multi-protocol work, but this is a small step in
     the right direction.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Enable mod_status by default.  This matches what Apache 1.3 does.

  *) Fix bug in the Unix threaded.c MPM that allowed child processes
     to fork() new child processes. 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a major security problem with double-reverse lookup 
     checking.  Previously, a client connecting over IPv4 would not be 
     matched properly when the server had an IPv6 listening socket.  
     PR #7407   [Taketo Kabe <kiabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Change the way the beos MPM handles polling to allow it to stop and
     restart.  Problem was the sockets being polled were being reset by
     the select call, so once it had accepted a connection it was no
     longer listening on the UDP socket we use for shutdown instructions.
     APR needs to be altered, patch on it's way. [David Reid]

  *) Empty out the brigade shared by ap_getline()/ap_get_client_block()
     on error exit from ap_getline().  Some other code got upset because
     the wrong data was in the brigade.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Handle ap_discard_request_body() being called more than once.
     [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get rid of an inadvertent close of file descriptor 2 in
     mod_mime_magic.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add a hook, create_request.  This hook allows modules to modify
     a request while it is being created.  This hook is called for all
     request_rec's, main request, sub request, and internal redirect.
     When this hook is called, the r->main, r->prev, r->next
     pointers have been set, so modules can determine what kind of
     request this is.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the build process a bit more.  The Apache configure
     script no longer creates its own helper scripts, it just
     uses APR's.

  *) Stop the forced downgrade of the connection to HTTP/1.0 for
     proxy requests.  [Graham Leggett]

  *) Avoid using sscanf to determine the HTTP protocol number in
     the common case because sscanf is a performance hog. From
     Mike Abbot's Accelerating Apache patch number 6.
     [Mike Abbot <mja trudge.engr.sgi.com>, Bill Stoddard]

  *) SECURITY: Fix a security exposure in mod_access.  Previously when 
     IPv6 listening sockets were used, allow/deny-from-IPv4-address rules 
     were not evaluated properly (PR #7407).  Also, add the ability to 
     specify IPv6 address strings with optional prefix length on Allow 
     and Deny.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Enhance rotatelogs so that a UTC offset can be specified, and
     the logfile name can be formatted using strftime(3).  (Brought
     forward from 1.3.)  [Ken Coar]

  *) Reimplement the Windows MPM (mpm_winnt.c) to eliminate calling 
     DuplicateHandle on an IOCompletionPort (a practice which
     MS "discourages"). The new model does not rely on associating
     the completion port with the listening sockets, thus the
     completion port can be completely managed within the child 
     process.  A dedicated thread accepts connections off the network,
     then calls PostQueuedCompletionStatus() to wake up worker
     threads blocked on the completion port.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Bring forward the --suexec-umask option which allows the
     builder to preset the umask for suexec processes.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add a -V flag to suexec, which causes it to display the
     compile-time settings with which it was built.  (Only
     usable by root or the AP_HTTPD_USER username.)  [Ken Coar]

  *) Mod_include should always unset the content-length if the file is
     going to be passed through send_parsed_content.  There is no to
     determine if the content will change before actually scanning the
     entire content.  It is far safer to just remove the C-L as long
     as we are scanning it.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make sure Apache sends WWW-Authenticate during a reverse proxy
     request and not Proxy-Authenticate.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin sharp.fm>]

Changes with Apache 2.0.14

  *) Fix content-length computation.  We ONLY compute a content-length if
     We are not in a 1.1 request and we cannot chunk, and this is a keepalive
     or we already have all the data.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Report unbounded containers in the config file.  Previously, a typo
     in the </container> directive could result in the rest of the config
     file being silently ignored, with undesired defaults used.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make the old_write filter use the ap_f* functions for the buffering.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move more code from the http module into the core server.  This
     is core code, basically the default handler, the default input
     and output filters, and all of the core configuration directives.
     All of this code is required in order for the server to work, with or
     without HTTP.  The server is closer to working without the HTTP
     module, although there is still more to do.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a number of SGI compile warnings throughout the server.  Fix some
     bad parameters to apr_bucket_read().  Fix a bad statement in 
     ap_method_in_list().  For the mod_rewrite cache use apr_time_t 
     consistently; we were mixing apr_time_t and time_t in invalid ways 
     before.  In load_file(), call apr_dso_error() instead of 
     apr_strerror() so that we get a more specific string on some platforms.
     PR #6980  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow modules to query the MPM about it's execution profile.  This
     query API can and should be extended in the future, but for now,
     max_daemons, and threading or forking is a very good start.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis covalent.net>]

  *) Modify mod_include to send blocks of data no larger than 9k.
     Without this, mod_include will wait until the whole file is parsed,
     or the first tag is found to send any data to the client.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Fix mod_info, so that <Directory> and <Location> directives are
     not displayed twice when displaying the current configuration.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Add config directives to override DEFAULT_ERROR_MSG and
     DEFAULT_TIME_FORMAT.  This was sent in as PR 6193.
     [Dan Rench <drench xnet.com>]

  *) Get mod_info building and loading on Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Begin to move protocol independant functions out of mod_http.  The goal
     is to have only functions that are HTTP specific in the http directory.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.13

  *) Don't assume that there will always be multiple calls to the byterange 
     filter.  It is possible that we will need to do byteranges with only
     one call to the filter.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Move the error_bucket definition from the http module to the
     core server.  Every protocol will need this ability, not just
     HTTP.  [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.12

  *) Modify mod_file_cache to save pre-formatted strings for 
     content-length and last-modified headers for performance. 
     [Mike Abbot <mja trudge.engr.sgi.com>]

  *) Namespace protect IOBUFSIZ since it is exposed in the API.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis covalent.net>]

  *) Use "Basic" authentication instead of "basic" in ab, as the spec
     says we should.  [Andre Breiler <andre.breiler rd.bbc.co.uk>]

  *) Fix a seg fault in mod_userdir.c.  We used to use the pw structure
     without ever filling it out.  This fixes PR 7271.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp> and 
      Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]

  *) Add a couple of GCC attribute tags to printf style functions.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis covalent.net>]

  *) Add the correct language tag for interoperation with the Taiwanese
     versions of MSIE and Netscape. [Clive Lin <clive CirX.ORG>] PR#7142

  *) Migrate the perchild MPM to use the new apr signal child, and 
     APR thread functions.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Close one copy of the CGI's stdout before creating the new process.
     The CGI will still have stdout, because we have already dup'ed it.
     This keeps Apache from waiting forever to send the results of a CGI
     process that has forked a long-lived child process.
     [Taketo Kabe <kabe sra-tohoku.co.jp>]

  *) Remove the rest of the pthreads functions from the threaded MPM.
     This requires the APR support for a signal thread that was just
     added.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make mod_dir use a fixup for sending a redirect to the browser.
     Before this, we were using a handler, which doesn't make much
     sense, because the handler wasn't generating any data, it would
     either return a redirect error code, or DECLINED.  This fits the
     current hooks better.  [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Make the threaded MPM use APR threads instead of pthreads.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get mod_tls to the point where it actually appears to work in all cases.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) implement --enable-modules and --enable-mods-shared for "all" and
     "most".  [Greg Stein]

  *) Move the threaded MPM to use APR locks instead of pthread locks.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rename mpmt_pthread to threaded.  This is more in line with the
     fact that mpmt_pthread shouldn't be using pthreads directly, and
     it is a smaller name that doesn't tie into anything.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rename the module structures so that the exported symbol matches
     the file name, and it is easier to automate the installation
     process (generating LoadModule directives from the module filenames).
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Remove the coalesce filter.  With the ap_f* functions, this filter
     is no longer needed. [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0.11

  *) Remove the dexter MPM.  Perchild is the same basic idea, but it has the
     added feature of allowing a uid/gid per child process.  If no
     uid/gid is specified, then Perchild behaves exactly like dexter.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get perchild building again. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Don't disable threads just because we are using the prefork MPM.
     If somebody wants to compile without threads, they must now add
     --disable-threads to the configure command line.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin to move the calls to update_child_status into common code, so
     that each individual MPM does not need to update the scoreboard itself.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow mod_tls to compile under Unix boxes where openssl has been
     installed to the system include files.
     [Gomez Henri <new-httpd slib.fr>]

  *) Cleanup the mod_tls configure process.  This should remove any need
     to hand-edit any files.  We require OpenSSL 0.9.6 or later, but 
     configure doesn't check that yet.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add a very early prototype of SSL support (in mod_tls.c). It is
     vital that you read modules/tls/README before attempting to build
     it. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Fix a potential seg fault on all platforms.  David Reid fixed this
     on BEOS, but the problem could happen anywhere, so we don't want
     to #ifdef it. [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]
 
  *) Add new LogFormat directive, %D, to log time it takes to serve a
     request in microseconds. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Change AddInputFilter and AddOutputFilter to SetInputFilter and
     SetOutputFilter.  This corresponds nicely with the other Set 
     directives, which operate on containers while the Add* directives
     tend to work directly on extensions.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the header handling a bit.  This uses the apr_brigade_*
     functions for the buffering so that we don't need to compute
     the length of the headers before we actually create the header
     buffer.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow filters to buffer data using the ap_f* functions.  These have
     become macros that resolve directly to apr_brigade_*.  
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the Unix MPM's to do a graceful restart again.  If we are going
     to register a cleanup with ap_cleanup_scoreboard, then we have to
     kill the cleanup with the same function,  and that function can't be
     static.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Install all required header files.  Without these, it was not
     possible to compile some modules outside of the server.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the AliasMatch directive in Apache 2.0.  When we brought a patch
     forward from 1.3 to 2.0, we missed a single line, which broke regex
     aliases.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We have a poor abstraction in the protocol.  This is a temporary
     hack to fix the bug, but it will need to be fixed for real.  If
     we find an error while sending out a custom error response, we back
     up to the first non-OK request and send the data.  Then, when we send
     the EOS from finalize_request_protocol, we go to the last request,
     to ensure that we aren't sending an EOS to a request that has already
     received one.  Because the data is sent on a different request than
     the EOS, the error text never gets sent down the filter stack.  This
     fixes the problem by finding the last request, and sending the data
     with that request.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the server status page show the correct restart time, and
     thus the proper uptime. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move the CGI creation logic from mod_include to mod_cgi(d).  This
     should reduce the amount of duplicate code that is required to
     create CGI processes.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) ap_new_connection() closes the socket and returns NULL if a socket
     call fails.  Usually this is due to a connection which has been 
     reset.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move the Apache version information out of httpd.h and into release.h.
     This is in preparation for the first tag with the new tag and release
     system.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin restructuring scoreboard code to enable adding back in
     the ability to use IPC other than shared memory.
     Get mod_status working on Windows again. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Make mod_status work with 2.0.  This will work for prefork,
     mpmt_pthread, and dexter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Correct a typo in httpd.conf.

  *) Make mod_cgid work with SuExec.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Adopt apr user/group name features for mod_rewrite.  Eliminates some
     'extra' stat's for user/group since they should never occur, and now
     resolves the SCRIPT_USER and SCRIPT_GROUP, including on WinNT NTFS
     volumes.  [William Rowe]

  *) Adopt apr features to simplify mod_includes.  This changes the
     behavior of the USER_NAME variable, unknown uid's are now reported
     as USER_NAME="<unknown>" rather than the old user#000 result.
     WinNT now resolves USER_NAME on NTFS volumes.  [William Rowe]

  *) Adopt apr features for simplifing mod_userdir, and accept the new
     Win32/OS2 exceptions without hiccuping.  [William Rowe]

  *) Replace configure --with-optim option by using and saving the
     environment variable OPTIM instead.  This is needed because configure
     options do not support multiple flags separated by spaces.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some byterange handling.  If we get a byte range that looks like
     "-999999" where that is past the end of the file, we should return 
     a PARTIAL CONTENT status code, and return the whole file as one big
     byterange.  This matches the 1.3 handling now.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the error bucket a real meta-data bucket.  This means that the
     bucket length is 0, and a read returns NULL data.  If one of these
     buckets is passed down after the headers are sent, this data will
     just be ignored.  [Greg Stein]

  *) The prefork MPM wasn't killing child processes correctly if a restart
     signal was received while the process was serving a request.  The child
     process would become the equivalent of a second parent process.  If
     we break out of the accept loop, then we need to do die after cleaning
     up after ourselves.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change the Prefork MPM to use SIGWINCH instead of SIGUSR1 for graceful
     restarts.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Modify the apr_stat/lstat/getfileinfo calls within apache to use
     the most optimal APR_FINFO_wanted bits.  This spares Win32 from
     performing very expensive owner, group and permission lookups
     and allows the server to function until these apr_finfo_t fields
     are implemented under Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Support for typedsafe optional functions - that is functions exported by
     optional modules, which, therefore, may or may not be present, depending
     on configuration. See the experimental modules mod_optional_fn_{ex,im}port
     for sample code. [Ben Laurie]

  *) filters can now report an HTTP error to the server.  This is done
     by sending a brigade where the first bucket is an error_bucket.
     This bucket is a simple bucket that stores an HTTP error and
     a string.  Currently the string is not used, but it may be needed
     to output an error log.  The http_header_filter will find this
     bucket, and output the error text, and then return 
     AP_FILTER_ERROR, which informs the server that the error web page
     has already been sent.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) If we get an error, then we should remove all filters except for
     those critical to serving a web page.  This fixes a bug, where
     error pages were going through the byterange filter, even though
     that made no sense.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Relax the syntax checking of Host: headers in order to support
     iDNS. PR#6635 [Tony Finch]

  *) Cleanup the byterange filter to use the apr_brigade_partition
     and apr_bucket_copy functions.  This removes a lot of very messy
     code, and hopefully makes this filter more stable.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove AddModule and ClearModuleList directives.  Both of these
     directives were used to ensure that modules could be enabled
     in the correct order.  That requirement is now gone, because
     we use hooks to ensure that modules are in the correct order.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) When SuExec is specified, we need to add it to the list of
     targets to be built.  If we don't, then any changes to the
     configuration won't affect SuExec, unless 'make suexec' is
     specifically run.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleaned out open_file from mod_file_cache, as apr now accepts
     the APR_XTHREAD argument to open a file for consumption by
     parallel threads on win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Correct a bug in determining when we follow symlinks.  The code
     expected a stat -1 result, not an apr_status_t positive error.
     Also check if the APR_FINFO_USER fields are valid before we
     follow the link.  [William Rowe]

  *) Move initgroupgs, ap_uname2id and ap_gname2id from util.c to
     mpm_common.c.  These functions are only valid on some platforms,
     so they should not be in the main-line code. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove ap_chdir_file().  This function is not thread-safe,
     and nobody is currently using it.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Do not try to run make depend if there are no .c files in the
     current directory, doing so makes `make depend` fail.
     [Ryan Bloom]

   *) Update highperformance.conf to work with either prefork or
      pthreads mpms.  [Greg Ames] 

  *) Stop checking to see if this is a pipelined request if we know
     for a fact that it isn't.  Basically, if r->connection->keepalive == 0.
     This keeps us from making an extra read call when serving a 1.0
     request.  [Ryan Bloom and Greg Stein]

  *) Fix the handling of variable expansion look-ahead in mod_rewrite,
     i.e. syntax like %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER}, and also fix the parsing of
     more complicated nested RewriteMap lookups. PR#7087 [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix the RFC number mentioned when complaining about a missing
     Host: header. PR#7079 [Alexey Toptygin <alexeyt wam.umd.edu>]

  *) Fix an endless loop in ab which occurred when ab was posting
     and the server dropped the connection unexpectedly.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a segfault while handling request bodies in ap_http_filter().  
     This problem has been seen with mod_dav usage as well as with 
     requests where the body was just being discarded.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Some adjustment on the handling and automatic setting (via
     hints.m4) of various compilation flags (eg: CFLAGS). Also,
     add the capability to specify flags (NOTEST_CFLAGS and
     NOTEST_LDFLAGS) which are used to compile Apache, but
     not used during the configuration process. Useful for
     flags like "-Werror". [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Stop using environment variables to force debug mode or
     no detach.  We now use the -D command line argument to 
     specify the correct mode.  -DONE_PROCESS and -DNO_DETACH.
     [Greg Stein, Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change handlers to use hooks. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Stop returning copies of filenames from both apr_file_t and
     apr_dir_t.  We pstrdup the filenames that we store in the
     actual structures, so we don't need to pstrdup the strings again.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_cgi: Fix some problems where the wrong error value was being
     traced.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) EBCDIC: Fix some missing ASCII conversion on some protocol data.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add generic hooks. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Use a real pool to dup the error log descriptor.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a segfault caused by mod_ext_filter when the external filter 
     program does not exist. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix an output truncation error when on an HTTP >= 1.0 request an
     object of size between DEFAULT_BUCKET_SIZE and AP_MIN_BYTES_TO_WRITE 
     was served through mod_charset_lite (or anything else that would
     create a transient bucket in this size range).  ap_bucket_make_heap()
     silently failed (fixed), transient_setaside() discovered it, but
     ap_save_brigade() ignored it (fixed). [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Ignore \r\n or \n when using PEEK mode for input filters.  The problem
     is that some browsers send extra lines at the end of POST requests, and
     we don't want to delay sending data back to the user just because the
     browser isn't well behaved. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get SuEXEC working again.  We can't send absolute paths to suExec
     because it refuses to execute those programs.  SuEXEC also wasn't
     always recognizing configuration changes made using the autoconf
     setup.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow the buildconf process to find the config.m4 files in the correct
     order.  Basically, we can now name config.m4 files as config\d\d.m4,
     and we will sort them correctly when inserting them into the build
     process.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get mod_cgid to use apr calls for creating the actual CGI process.
     This also allows mod_cgid to use ap_os_create_priviledged_process,
     thus allowing for SuExec execution from mod_cgid.  Currently, we do
     not support everything that standard SuExec supports, but at least
     it works minimally now. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow SuExec to be configured from the ./configure command line.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Update some of the docs in README and INSTALL to reflect some of
     the changes in Apache 2.0 [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]

  *) If we get EAGAIN returned from the call to apr_sendfile, then we
     need to call sendfile again.  This gets us serving large files
     such as apache_2.0a9.tar.gz on FreeBSD again. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the support programs building cleanly again.
     [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]

  *) The Apache/Win32 Apache.exe and dll's now live in bin.  The 
     current directory logic now backs up over bin/ to determine the
     server root from the Apache.exe path.

  *) Apache/Win32 now follows the standard conventions of mod_foo.so
     loadable modules, dynamic libs are all named libfoo.dll, and the
     makefile.win populates the include, lib and libexec directories.

  *) Apache is now IPv6-capable.  On systems where APR supports IPv6,
     Apache gets IPv6 listening sockets by default.  Additionally, the
     Listen, NameVirtualHost, and <VirtualHost> directives support IPv6
     numeric address strings (e.g., "Listen [fe80::1]:8080").
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Modify the install directory layout.  Modules are now installed in
     modules/.  Shared libraries should be installed in libraries/, but
     we don't have any of those on Unix yet.  All install directories
     are modifyable at configure time. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Install all header files in the same directory on Unix. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the functions in server/linked into the server, regardless of
     which modules linked into the server.  This uses the same hack 
     for Apache that we use for APR and apr-util to ensure all of the
     necessary functions are linked.  As a part of thise, the CHARSET_EBCDIC
     was renamed to AP_CHARSET_EBCDIC for namespace protection, and to make
     the scripts a bit easier.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Rework the RFC1413 handling to make it thread-safe, use a timeout
     on the query, and remove IPv4 dependencies.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get all of the auth modules to the point that they will install and
     be loadable into the server.  Our new build/install mechanism expects
     that all modules will have a common name format.  The auth modules 
     didn't use that format, so we didn't install them properly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) API routines ap_pgethostbyname() and ap_pduphostent() are no longer
     available.  Use apr_getaddrinfo() instead.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get "NameVirtualHost *" working in 2.0.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Return HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE if the every range requested starts
     after the end of the response. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get byterange requests working with responses that do not have a
     content-length.  Because of the way byterange requests work, we have to
     have all of the data before we can actually do the byterange, so we
     can compute the content-length in the byterange filter.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get exe CGI's working again on Windows.
     [Allan Edwards]

  *) Get mod_cgid and mod_rewrite to work as DSOs by changing the way
     they keep track of whether or not their  post config hook has been
     called before.  Instead of a static variable (which is replaced when 
     the DSO is loaded a second time), use userdata in the process pool.
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a9

  *) Win32 now requires perl to complete the final install step for users
     to build + install on Win32.  Makefile.win now rewrites @@ServerRoot@
     and installs the conf, htdocs and htdocs/manual directories.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make mod_include use a hash table to associate directive tags with
     functions.  This allows modules to implement their own SSI tags easily.
     The idea is simple enough, a module can insert it's own tag and function
     combination into a hash table provided by mod_include.  While mod_include
     parses an SSI file, when it encounters a tag in the file, it does a
     hash lookup to find the function that implements that tag, and passes
     all of the relevant data to the function.  That function is then
     responsible for processing the tag and handing the remaining data back
     to mod_include for further processing.
     [Paul J. Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Get rid of ap_new_apr_connection().  ap_new_connection() now has 
     fewer parameters: the local and remote socket addresses were removed
     from the parameter list because all required information is available
     via the APR socket.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Distribution directory structure reorganized to reflect a
     normal source distribution with external install targets.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) The MPMs that need multiple segments of shared memory now create
     two apr_shmem_t variables, one for each shared memory allocation.
     the problem is that we can't determine how much memory will be required
     for shared memory allocations once we try to allocate more than one
     variable.  The MM code automatically aligns the shared memory allocations,
     so we end up needing to pad the amount of shared memory we want based
     on how many variables will be allocated out of the shared memory segment.
     It is just easier to create a second apr_shmem_t variable, and two
     shmem memory blocks.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Cleanup the export list a bit.  This creates a single unified list of
     functions exported by APR.  The export list is generated at configure
     time, and that list is then used to generate the exports.c file.
     Because of the way the export list is generated, we only export those
     functions that are valid on the platform we are building on.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Enable logging the cookie with mod_log_config
     [Sander van Zoest <sander covalent.net>]

  *) Fix a segfault in mod_info when it reaches the end of the configuration.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Added lib/aputil/ as a placeholder for utility functions which are not
     specific to the Apache HTTP Server (but do not make sense with APR).
     The first utility is "apu_dbm": a set of functions to work with DBM
     files. This first version can be compiled for SDBM or GDBM databases.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Complete re-write of mod_include.  This makes mod_include a filter that
     uses buckets directly.  This has now served the FAQ correctly.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Allow modules to specify the first filter in a sub_request when
     making the sub_request.  This keeps modules from having to change the
     output_filter immediately after creating the sub-request, and therefore
     skip the sub_req_output_filter.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Update ab to accept URLs with IPv6 literal address strings (in the
     format described in RFC 2732), and to build Host header fields in
     the same format.  This allows IPv6 literal address strings to be
     used with ab.  This support has been tested against Apache 1.3 with 
     the KAME patch, but Apache 2.0 does not yet work with this format
     of the Host header field.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Accomodate an out-of-space condition in the piped logs and the
     rotatelogs.c code, and no longer churn log processes for this
     condition.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Add support for partial writes with apr_sendfile() to core_output_filter.
     [Greg Ames] 

Changes with Apache 2.0a8

  *) Add a directive to mod_mime so that filters can be associated with
     a given mime-type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get multi-views working again.  We were setting the path_info
     field incorrectly if we couldn't find the specified file.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix 304 processing.  The core should never try to send the headers
     down the filter stack.  Always, just setup the table in the request
     record, and let the header filter convert it to data that is ready
     for the network.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) More fixes for the proxy.  There are still bugs in the proxy code,
     but this has now proxied www.yahoo.com and www.ntrnet.net (my ISP)
     successfully.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix params for apr_getaddrinfo() call in connect proxy handler.
     [Chuck Murcko]

  *) APR: Add new apr_getopt_long function to handle long options.
     [B. W. Fitzpatrick <fitz red-bean.com>]

  *) APR: Change apr_connect() to take apr_sockaddr_t instead of hostname.
     Add generic apr_create_socket().  Add apr_getaddrinfo() for doing
     hostname resolution/address string parsing and building
     apr_sockaddr_t.  Add apr_get_sockaddr() for getting the address
     of one of the apr_sockaddr_t structures for a socket.  Change
     apr_bind() to take apr_sockaddr_t.  [David Reid and Jeff Trawick]

  *) Remove the BUFF from the HTTP proxy.  This is still a bit ugly, but
     I have proxied pages with it, cleanup will commence soon.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make the proxy work with filters.  This isn't perfect, because we
     aren't dealing with the headers properly.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Do not send a content-length iff the C-L is 0 and this is a head
     request.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make cgi-bin work as a regular directory when using mod_vhost_alias
     with no VirtualScriptAlias directives. PR#6829 [Tony Finch]

  *) Remove BUFF from the PROXY connect handling. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Get the default_handler to stop trying to deal with HEAD requests.
     The idea is to let the content-length filter compute the C-L before
     we try to send the data.  If we can get the C-L correctly, then we
     should send it in the HEAD response.
     [Ryan Bloom]
     
  *) The Header filter can now determine if a body should be sent based
     on r->header_only.  The general idea of this is that if we delay
     deciding to send the body, then we might be able to compute the
     content-length correctly, which will help caching proxies to cache
     our data better.  Any handler that doesn't want to try to compute
     the content-length can just send an EOS bucket without data and
     everything will just work.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add the referer to the error log if one is available.
     [Markus Gyger <mgyger itr.ch>]

  *) Mod_info.c has now been ported to Apache 2.0.  As a part of this
     change, the root of the configuration tree has been exposed to modules
     as ap_conftree.
     [Ryan Morgan <rmorgan covalent.net>]

  *) Get the core_output_filter to use the bucket interface directly.
     This keeps us from calling the content-length filter multiple times
     for a simple static request.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) We are sending the content-type correctly now.
     [Ryan Bloom and Will Rowe]

  *) APR on FreeBSD: Fix a bug in apr_sendfile() which caused us to report
     a bogus bytes-sent value when the only thing being sent was trailers
     and writev() returned an error (or EAGAIN).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Get SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT working again.  This uses the
     hints file to determine which platforms define 
     SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR: add apr_get_home_directory()  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Initial import of 1.3-current mod_proxy. [Chuck Murcko]

  *) Not all platforms have INADDR_NONE defined by default.  Apache
     used to make this check and define INADDR_NONE if appropriate,
     but APR needs the check too, and I suspect other applications will
     as well.  APR now defines APR_INADDR_NONE, which is always a valid
     value on all platforms.
     [Branko Čibej <brane xbc.nu>]

  *) Destroy the pthread mutex in lock_intra_cleanup() for PR#6824.
     [Shuichi Kitaguchi <ki hh.iij4u.or.jp>] 

  *) Relax the syntax checking of Host: headers in order to support
     iDNS. PR#6635 [Tony Finch]

  *) When reading from file buckets we convert to an MMAP if it makes
     sense.  This also simplifies the default handler because the
     default handler no longer needs to try to create MMAPs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) BUFF has been removed from the main server.  The BUFF code will remain
     in the code until it has been purged from the proxy module as well.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Byteranges have been completely re-written to be a filter.  This
     has been tested, and I believe it is working correctly, but it could
     doesn't work for the Adobe Acrobat plug-in.  The output almost matches
     the output from 1.3, the only difference being that 1.3 includes
     a content-length in the response, and this does not.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR read/write functions and bucket read functions now operate
     on unsigned integers, instead of signed ones.  It doesn't make
     any sense to use signed ints, because we return the error codes,
     so if we have an error we should report 0 bytes read or written.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Always compute the content length, whether it is sent or not.
     The reason for this, is that it allows us to correctly report
     the bytes_sent when logging the request.  This also simplifies
     content-length filter a bit, and fixes the actual byte-reporing
     code in mod_log_config.c
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Remove AP_END_OF_BRIGADE definition.  This does not signify what
     it says, because it was only used by EOS and FLUSH buckets.  Since
     neither of those are required at the end of a brigade, this was
     really signifying FLUSH_THE_DATA, but that can be determined better
     by checking AP_BUCKET_IS_EOS() or AP_BUCKET_IS_FLUSH.  EOS and FLUSH
     buckets now return a length of 0, which is actually the amount of data
     read, so they make more sense.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow the core_output_filter to save some data past the end of a
     request.  If we get an EOS bucket, we only send the data if it 
     makes sense to send it.  This allows us to pipeline request
     responses.  As a part of this, we also need to allocate mmap
     buckets out of the connection pool, not the request pool.  This
     allows the mmap to outlive the request.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make blocking and non-blocking bucket reads work correctly for
     sockets and pipes.  These are the only bucket types that should
     have non-blocking reads, because the other bucket types should
     ALWAYS be able to return something immediately.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) In the Apache/Win32 console window, accept Ctrl+C to stop the 
     server, but use Ctrl+Break to initiate a graceful restart 
     instead of duplicating behavior. [John Sterling]

  *) Patch mod_autoindex to set the Last-Modified header based on
     the directory's mtime, and add the ETag header.  [William Rowe]

  *) Merge the 1.3 patch to add support for logging query string in 
     such a way that "%m %U%q %H" is the same as "%r".
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Port three log methods from mod_log_config 1.3 to 2.0: 
     CLF compliant '-' byte count, method and protocol.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add a new LogFormat directive, %c, that will log connection
     status at the end of the response as follows:
     'X' - connection aborted before the response completed.
     '+' - connection may be kept-alive by the server.
     '-' - connection will be closed by the server.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Expand APR for WinNT to fully accept and return utf-8 encoded
     Unicode file names and paths for Win32, and tag the Content-Type 
     from mod_autoindex to reflect that charset if the feature
     macro APR_HAS_UNICODE_FS is true.  [William Rowe]

  *) Compute the content length (and add appropriate header field) for
     the response when no content length is available and we can't use 
     chunked encoding.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Changed ap_discard_request_body() to use REQUEST_CHUNKED_DECHUNK,
     so that content input filters get dechunked data when using
     the default handler. Also removed REQUEST_CHUNKED_PASS.
     [Sascha Schumann]
     
  *) Add mod_ext_filter as an experimental module.  This module allows
     the administrator to use external programs as filters.  Currently,
     only filtering of output is supported.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Most Apache functions work on EBCDIC machines again, as protocol
     data is now translated (again).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Introduce ap_xlate_proto_{to|from}_ascii() to clean up some of
     the EBCDIC support.  They are noops on ASCII machines, so this
     type of translation doesn't have to be surrounded by #ifdef
     CHARSET_EBCDIC.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix mod_include.  tag commands work again, and the server will
     send the FAQ again.  This also allows mod_include to set aside
     buckets that include partial buckets.
     [Ryan Bloom and David Reid]

  *) Add suexec support back.  [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Lingering close now uses the socket directly instead of using
     BUFF.  This has been tested, but since all we can tell is that it
     doesn't fail, this needs to be really hacked on.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow filters to modify headers and have those headers be sent to
     the client.  The idea is that we have an http_header filter that
     actually sends the headers to the network.  This removes the need
     for the BUFF to send headers.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Charset translation: mod_charset_lite handles translation of
     request bodies.  Get rid of the xlate version of ap_md5_digest()
     since we don't compute digests of filtered (e.g., translated) 
     response bodies this way anymore.  (Note that we don't do it at
     all at the present; somebody needs to write a filter to do so.)
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Input filters and ap_get_brigade() now have a input mode parameter 
     (blocking, non-blocking, peek) instead of a length parameter.
     [hackathon]

  *) Update the mime.types file to the registered media types as
     of 2000-10-19. PR#6613 [Carsten Klapp <carsten.klapp home.net>,
     Tony Finch]

  *) Namespace protect some macros declared in ap_config.h
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Support HTTP header line folding with input filtering.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Mod_include works again.  This should still be re-written, but at
     least now we can serve an SHTML page again.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Begin to remove BUFF from the core.  Currently, we keep a pointer
     to both the BUFF and the socket in the conn_rec.  Functions that
     want to use the BUFF can, functions that want to use the socket,
     can.  They point to the same place.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_psprintf doesn't understand %lld as a format.  Make it %ld.
     [Tomas Ögren <stric ing.umu.se>]

  *) APR pipes on Unix and Win32 are now cleaned up automatically when the 
     associated pool goes away.  (APR pipes on OS/2 were already had this
     logic.)  This resolvs a fatal file descriptor leak with CGIs.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The final line of the config file was not being read if there was
     no \n at the end of it.  This was caused by apr_fgets returning 
     APR_EOF even though we had read valid data.  This is solved by
     making cfg_getline check the buff that was returned from apr_fgets.
     If apr_fgets return APR_EOF, but there was data in the buf, then we
     return the buf, otherwise we return NULL.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Piped logs work again in the 2.0 series.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Restore functionality broken by the mod_rewrite security fix:
     rewrite map lookup keys and default values are now expanded
     so that the lookup can depend on the requested URI etc.
     PR #6671 [Tony Finch]

  *) SECURITY: Tighten up the syntax checking of Host: headers to fix a
     security bug in some mass virtual hosting configurations
     that can allow a remote attacker to retrieve some files
     on the system that should be inaccessible. [Tony Finch]

  *) Add a pool bucket type.  This bucket is used for data allocated out
     of a pool.  If the pool is cleaned before the bucket is destroyed, then
     the data is converted to a heap bucket, allowing it to survive the
     death of the pool.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add a flush bucket.  This allows modules to signal that the filters
     should all flush whatever data they currently have.  There is no way
     to actually force them to do this, so if a filter ignores this bucket,
     that's life, but at least we can try with this.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add an output filter for sub-requests.  This filter just strips the
     EOS bucket so that we don't confuse the main request's core output
     filter by sending multiple EOS buckets.  This change also makes sub
     requests start to send EOS buckets when they are finished.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Make ap_bucket_(read|destroy|split|setaside) into macros.  Also
     makes ap_bucket_destroy a return void, which is okay because it
     used to always return APR_SUCCESS, and nobody ever checked its
     return value anyway.
     [Cliff Woolley <cliffwoolley yahoo.com>]

  *) Remove the index into the bucket-type table from the buckets
     structure.  This has now been replaced with a pointer to the
     bucket_type.  Also add some macros to test the bucket-type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Renamed all MODULE_EXPORT symbols to AP_MODULE_DECLARE and all symbols
     for CORE_EXPORT to AP_CORE_DECLARE (namespace protecting the wrapper)
     and retitled API_EXPORT as AP_DECLARE and APR_EXPORT as APR_DECLARE.
     All _VAR_ flavors changes to _DATA to be absolutely clear.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add support for /, //, //servername and //server/sharename 
     parsing of <Directory> blocks under Win32 and OS2.
     [Tim Costello, William Rowe, Brian Harvard]

  *) Remove the function pointers from the ap_bucket type.  They have been
     replaced with a global table.  Modules are allowed to register bucket
     types and use then use those buckets.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_cgid: In the handler, shut down the Unix socket (only for write) 
     once we finish writing the request body to the cgi child process; 
     otherwise, the client doesn't hit EOF on stdin.  Small request bodies 
     worked without this change (for reasons I don't understand), but large 
     ones didn't.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Remove file bucket specific information from the ap_bucket type.
     This has been moved to a file_bucket specific type that hangs off
     the data pointer in the ap_bucket type.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Input filtering now has a third argument.  This is the amount of data
     to read from lower filters.  This argument can be -1, 0, or a positive
     number.  -1 means give me all the data you have, I'll deal with it and
     let you know if I need more.  0 means give me one line and one line
     only.  A positive number means I want no more than this much data.

     Currently, only 0 and a positive number are implemented.  This allows
     us to remove the remaining field from the conn_rec structure, which
     has also been done.
     [Ryan Bloom] 
    
  *) Big cleanup of the input filtering.  The goal is that http_filter
     understands two conditions, headers and body.  It knows where it is
     based on c->remaining.  If c->remaining is 0, then we are in headers,
     and http_filter returns a line at a time.  If it is not 0, then we are
     in body, and http_filter returns raw data, but only up to c->remaining
     bytes.  It can return less, but never more.
     [Greg Ames, Ryan Bloom, Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgi: Write all of the request body to the child, not just what
     the kernel would accept on the first write.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Back out the change that moved the brigade from the core_output_filters
     ctx to the conn_rec.  Since all requests over a given connection
     go through the same core_output_filter, the ctx pointer has the
     correct lifetime.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix another bug in the send_the_file() read/write loop. A partial
     send by apr_send would cause unsent data in the read buffer to
     get clobbered. Complete making send_the_file handle partial
     writes to the network.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix a couple of type fixes to allow compilation on AIX again
     [Victor J. Orlikowski <v.j.orlikowski gte.net>]

  *) Fix bug in send_the_file() which causes offset to be ignored
     if there are no headers to send.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Handle APR_ENOTIMPL returned from apr_sendfile in the core
     filter. Useful for supporting Windows 9* with a binary
     compiled on Windows NT.
     [Bill Stoddard]

Changes with Apache 2.0a7

  *) Reimplement core_output_filter to buffer/save bucket brigades
     across multiple calls to the core_filter. The brigade will be
     sent when either MIN_BYTES_TO_SEND or MAX_IOVEC_TO_WRITE
     thresholds are hit or the EOS bucket is received.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Create experimental filter (buffer_filter) that coalesces bytes 
     into one large buffer before invoking the next filter in the
     chain. This filter is particularly useful with the current 
     implementation of mod_autoindex when it inserted above the
     chunk_filter. mod_autoindex generates a lot of brigades that
     containing buckets holding just a few bytes each. The
     buffer_filter coalesces these buckets into a single large bucket.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add apr_sendfile() support into the core_output_filter.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Add apr_sendv() support into the core_output_filter.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix mod_log_config so that it compiles cleanly with BUFFERED_LOGS
     [Mike Abbott <mja sgi.com>]

  *) Remove ap_send_fb.  This is no longer used in Apache, and it doesn't
     make much sense, because Apache uses buckets instead of BUFFs now.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) send_the_file now falls back to a read/write loop on platforms that
     do not have sendfile.
     [Ryan Bloom and Brian Havard]

  *) Install apachectl correctly, and substitute the proper values so
     that it works again.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Better(??) handle platforms that lack sendfile().
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) APR now has UUID generation/formatting/parsing support.
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Begin the http_filter.  This is an input filter that understands
     the absolute basic amount required to parse an HTTP Request.  The
     goal is to be able to split headers from request body before passing
     the data back to the other filters.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Bring forward from 1.3.13 the config directory implementation
     [Jim Jagielski]

  *) install apxs if it is created
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Added APR_IS_STATUS_condition test macros to eliminate canonical error
     conversions.  [William Rowe]

  *) Now that we have ap_add_input_filter(), rename ap_add_filter() to 
     ap_add_output_filter().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Multiple build and configuration fixes
    Build process:

      -add datadir and localstatedir substitutions
      -fix layout name
      -fix logfilename misspelling
      -fix evaluation of installation dir variables and
      -replace $foobar by $(foobar) to be usefull in the makefile
    
    Cross compile:
    
      -add rules for cross-compiling in rules.mk. Okay, rule to check for
       $CC_FOR_BUILD is still missing
      -use CHECK_TOOL instead of CHECK_PROG for ranlib
      -add missing "AR=@AR@" to severaly Makefile.in's
      -cache result for "struct rlimit"
      -compile all helper programs with native and cross compiler
       and use the native version to generate header file
     [Rüdiger Kuhlmann <Tadu gmx.de>]

  *) Prepare our autoconf setup for autoconf 2.14a and for cross-
     compiling.
     [Rüdiger Kuhlmann <Tadu gmx.de>]

  *) Fix a bug where a client which only sends \n to delimit header
     lines (netcat) gets a strange looking HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED 
     message.  Start working on ebcdic co-existance with input 
     filtering.
     [William Rowe, Greg Ames]

  *) If mod_so is enabled in the server always create libexec, even
     if there are no modules installed in this directory.  This is a
     requirement for APXS to work correctly.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Connection oriented output filters are now stored in the 
     conn_rec instead of the request_rec.  This allows us to add the
     output filter in the pre-connection phase instead of the
     post_read_request phase, which keeps us from trying to write an
     error page before we have a filter to write to the network.
     [Ryan Bloom, Jeff Trawick, and Greg Ames]

  *) Cleaning up an mmap bucket no longer deletes the mmap.  An
     mmap can be used across multiple buckets (default_handler with
     byte ranges, mod_file_cache, mod_mmap_static), so cleanup of
     the mmap itself can't be associated with the bucket.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add .dll caching directive ISAPICacheFile to mod_isapi.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Radical surgery to improve mod_isapi support under Win32.
     Includes a number of newer ServerSupportFunction calls, support
     for ReadClient (in order to retrieve POSTs greater than 48KB),
     and general bug fixes to more reliably load ISAPI .dll's and
     prevent leaking handle resources.  Note: There are still 
     discrepancies between IIS's and Apache's ServerVariables, and
     async calls are still not supported.  Additional warnings are
     logged to facilitate debugging of unsupported ISAPI calls.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add input filtering to Apache.  The basic idea for the input
     filters is the same as the ideas for output filters.  The biggest
     difference is that instead of calling ap_pass_brigade, ap_get_brigade
     should be called, and the order of execution for the filter itself is
     different.  When writing an output filter, a brigade is passed in,
     and filters operate directly on that brigade, when done, they call
     ap_pass_brigade.  Input filters are the exact opposite.  Because input
     is not a push operation, filters first call ap_get_brigade.  When this
     function returns, the input filter will be left with a valid brigade.
     The input filter should then operate on the brigade, and return.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix building on BSD/OS using its native make. The build system
     falls back to the BSD .include directive on that host platform.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Expand dbmmanage to allow -d -m -s -p options for Crypt, MD5,
     SHA1 and plaintext password encodings.  Make feature tests a
     bit more flexible.  [William Rowe]

  *) Charset translation: mod_charset_lite handles output content 
     translation in a filter.  mod_charset_lite no longer ignores 
     subrequests.  A bunch of cruft related to BUFF's support for
     translating request and response bodies was removed.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move the addition of the CORE filter to the post_read_request
     hook in http_core.c.  This removes the need to add the filter in
     multiple places and allows for an SSL module to be added much
     simpler. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2000-0913 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix a security problem that affects certain configurations of
     mod_rewrite. If the result of a RewriteRule is a filename that
     contains expansion specifiers, especially regexp backreferences
     $0..$9 and %0..%9, then it may be possible for an attacker to
     access any file on the web server. [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix a bug where errors that are detected during early request parsing
     don't produce visible HTTP error messages at the browser, because
     the core_filter wasn't present.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Provide apr_socklen_t as a portability aid. 
     [Victor  J. Orlikowski]

  *) Overhaul of dbmmanage to allow a groups arg (as in Apache 1.2)
     as well as a comment arg to the add, adduser and update cmds.
     update allows the user to clear or preserve pw/groups/comment.
     Fixed a bug in dbmmanage that prevented the check option from 
     parsing a password followed by :group... text.  Corrected the
     seed calcualation for Win32 systems, and added -lsdbm support.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Configured mod_auth_dbm to compile with sdbmlib under Win32.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Avoid a segfault when parsing .htaccess files.  An 
     uninitialized tree pointer was passed to ap_build_config().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the way that inet_addr & inet_network are checked for
     in APR's configure process to allow BeOS BONE to correctly
     find them. With this change BeOS BONE now builds from source
     with no problems.  [David Reid]

  *) Fix a bug in apr_create_process() for Unix.  The NULL signifying
     the end of the parameters to execve() was stored in the wrong
     location, overlaying the storage beyond the newargs[] array and 
     also passing uninitialized storage to execve(), which would 
     sometimes fail with EFAULT.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug parsing configuration file containers.  With a sequence
     like this in the config file

       <IfModule mod_kilroy.c>
       any stuff
       </IfModule>
       <IfModule mod_lovejoy.c>
       (blank line)
       any stuff
       </IfModule>

     the second container would be terminated at the blank line due to
     sediment in the buffer from reading the prior </IfModule> and an 
     error message would be generated for the real </IfModule> for the
     second container.  Also due to this problem, any two characters 
     could be used for "</" in the close of a container.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) ap_add_filter prototype changed to remove the ctx pointer.  The
     pointer still remains in the filter structure, but it can not be
     a part of the ap_add_filter prototype.  The reason is that when
     the core uses AddFilter to add a filter to the stack it doesn't
     know how to allocate the ctx pointer, or even how much memory should
     be allocated.  The filters will have to be responsible for allocating
     the ctx memory when they need it.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add an AddFilter directive.  This directive takes a list of filters
     that should be activated for the requested resource.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_snprintf(): Get quad format strings working on OS/390 (and perhaps
     some other platforms).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Modify mod_include to be a filter.  Currently, it has only been tested
     on actual files, but it should work for CGI scripts too.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_putc(), apr_puts() for Unix: handle buffered files and interrupted
     writes.  apr_flush() for Unix: handle interrupted writes.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) NameVirtualHost can now take "*" as an argument instead of
     an IP address. This allows you to create a purely name-based
     virtual hosting server that does not have any IP addresses in
     the configuration file and which ignores the local address
     of any connections. PR #5595, PR #4455 [Tony Finch]

  *) Fix some compile warnings in mod_mmap_static.c
     [Mike Abbott <mja sgi.com>]

  *) Fix chunking problem with CGI scripts.  The general problem was that
     the CGI modules were adding an EOS bucket and then the core added an
     EOS bucket.  The chunking filter finalizes the chunked response when it
     encounters an EOS bucket.  Because two EOS buckets were sent, we
     finalized the response twice.  The fix is to make sure we only send one
     EOS, by utilizing a flag in the request_rec.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_put_os_file() now sets up the unget byte appropriately on Unix
     and Win32.  Previously, the first read from an apr_file_t set up via
     apr_put_os_file() would return a '\0'.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Mod_cgid now creates a single element bucket brigade, with a pipe
     bucket, instead of using BUFF's and ap_r*.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APRVARS.in no longer overwrites the EXTRA_LIBS variable.
     [Mike Abbott <mja sgi.com>]

  *) Remove ap_bopenf from buff code.  This required modifying the file_cache
     code to use APR file's directly instead of going through BUFFs.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix compile break on some platforms for mod_mime_magic.c
     [John K. Sterling <sterling covalent.net>]

  *) Fix merging of AddDefaultCharset directive.
     PR #5872 (1.3) [Jun Kuriyama <kuriyama imgsrc.co.jp>]

  *) Minor revamp of the rlimit sections of code. We now test
     explicitly for setrlimit and getrlimit. Also, unixd_set_rlimit()
     is now "available" even if the platform doesn't support
     the rlimit family (it's just a noop though). [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Migrate the pre-selection of which MPM to use for specific
     platforms to hints.m4, which contains (or should contain)
     all platform specific "hints". [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Remove IOLs from Apache.  With filtering, IOLs are no longer necessary
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add tables with non-string/binary values to APR.
     [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix some bad calls to ap_log_rerror() in mod_rewrite. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Update PCRE to version 3.2.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Change the way buckets' destroy functions are called so that
     they can be more directly used when changing the type of a
     bucket in place. [Tony Finch]

  *) Add generic support for reference-counting the resources used by
     buckets, and alter the HEAP and MMAP buckets to use it. Change
     the way buckets are initialised to support changing the type of
     buckets in place, and use it when setting aside TRANSIENT buckets.
     Change the implementation of TRANSIENT buckets so that it can be
     mostly shared with IMMORTAL buckets, which are now implemented.
     [Tony Finch]

Changes with Apache 2.0a6

  *) Add support to Apache and APR for dsos on OS/390.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Add a chunking filter to Apache.  This brings us one step closer
     to removing BUFF. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) ap_add_filter now adds filters in a LIFO fashion.  The first filter
     added to the stack is the last filter to be called.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Apache 2.0 has been completely documented using Scandoc.  The
     docs can be generated by running 'make docs'.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add filtered I/O to Apache.  This is based on bucket brigades,
     Currently the buckets still use BUFF under the covers, but that
     should change quickly.  The only currently written filter is the
     core filter which just calls ap_bwrite.  [The Apache Group]

  *) APR locks on Unix: Let APR_LOCKALL locks work when APR isn't
     built with thread support.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Abort configuration if --with-layout was specified and there's
     no layout definition file.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add support for '--with-port=n' option to configure.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Add support for extension methods for the Allow response header
     field, and an API routine for accessing r->allowed and the
     list of extension methods in a unified manner.  [Ken Coar]

  *) mod_cern_meta: fix broken file reading loop in scan_meta_file().
     [Rob Simonson <simo us.ibm.com>]

  *) Get xlate builds working again.  The apr renaming in 2.0a5 broke
     APACHE_XLATE builds.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) A configuration file parsing problem was fixed.  When the 
     configuration file started with an IfModule/IfDefine container, 
     only the last statement in the container would be retained.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a5

  *) Perchild is serving pages after passing them to different child
     processes.  There are still a lot of bugs, but this does work.  I
     have made requests against the same installation of Apache, and had
     different servers use different user IDs to serve the responses.
     This change moves to using socketpair instead of an AF_UNIX socket.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Perchild MPM still doesn't work perfectly, but it is serving pages.
     It can't seem to pass between child processes yet, but I think we
     are closer now than before.  This moves us back to using Unix
     Domain Sockets.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) libapr functions and types renamed with apr_ prefix.
     #include "apr_compat.h" for 1.3.x backwards compat
     [Perl]

  *) Fix problems with APR sockaddr handling on Win32.  It didn't always
     return the right information on the local socket address.
     [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls level8.com>]

  *) ap_recv() on Win32: Set bytes-read to 0 on error.  
     [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls level8.com>]

  *) Add an option to not detach from the controlling terminal without
     going into single process mode.  This allows for much easier
     debugging of the process startup code. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) ab: don't use perror() to report the failure of an APR function.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make dexter, mpmt_pthread, and perchild MPMs not destroy the
     scoreboard on graceful restarts.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix segfault/SIGSEGV when running gzip from mod_mime_magic.c.
     An invalid ap_proc_t was passed to ap_create_process().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Allow modules to register filters.  Those filters are still
     never called, but this is a step in the right direction.
     [Ryan Bloom and Greg Stein]

  *) Register the mod_cgid daemon process for cleanup so that it is
     killed at termination if it does not die when the parent gets
     SIGTERM.  This change is to fix occasional problems where the
     process stays around.  Bugs in similar logic in mod_rewrite and
     mod_include were also fixed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug in the time handling.  Basically, we were imploding a time
     in ap_parseHTTPdate, but it had bogus data in the exploded time format.
     Namely, tm_usec and tm_gmtoff were not filled out.  ap_implode_time
     uses those two fields to adjust the time value.  Because of the HTTP
     spec, both of those values can be zero'ed out safely.  This fixes
     the bug correctly.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a couple of place in the Windows code where the wrong error
     code was being returned. [Gregory Nicholls <gnicholls level8.com>]

  *) Fix POOL_DEBUG (at least for prefork mpm). [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Added the APR_EOL_STR macro for platform dependent differences in 
     logfiles and other raw text (such as all APR files).  Fixes logfiles
     not terminated with cr/lf sequences in Win32.  [William Rowe]

  *) Move all strings functions in APR to src/lib/apr/strings and create
     apr_strings.h for the prototypes. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) APR lock fixes: when using SysV sems, flock(), or fcntl(), be sure
     to repeat the syscall until we stop getting EINTR.  I noticed a
     related problem at termination (SIGTERM) on FreeBSD when using
     fcntl().  Apache 1.3 had these new loops too.  Also, make the flock() 
     implementation work properly with child init.  Previously, ap_lock()
     was essentially a no-op because all children were using different
     locks and thus nobody ever blocked.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The htdocs/ tree has been moved out of the CVS source tree into
     a separate area for easier development.  This has NO EFFECT on
     end-users or Apache installations.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Integrate the mod_dav module for WebDAV protocol handling. This
     adds the dav and dav_fs modules, the SDBM library, and additional
     XML handling utilities. [Greg Stein]

  *) Clean out obsolete names (from httpd.h) for the HTTP Status Codes
     [Greg Stein]

  *) Update the lib/expat-lite/ library (bring forward changes from
     the Apache 1.3 repository). [Greg Stein]

  *) If sizeof(long long) == sizeof(long), then prefer long in APR
     configure.in.  [Dave Hill <ddhill zk3.dec.com>]

  *) Add ap_sendfile for Tru64 Unix.  Also, add an error message for
     machines where sendfile is detected, but nobody has written ap_sendfile.
     [Dave Hill <ddhill zk3.dec.com>]

  *) Compile fixes in mod_mmap_static.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) ab would start up more connections than needed, then quit when the
     desired number were finished. Also fixed a logic error involving
     ab keepalives.  [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) WinNT: Implement non-blocking pipes with timeouts to communicate
     with CGIs. Apache 2.0a4 had non-blocking pipes but without 
     timeouts (i.e, if a timeout was specified, the pipe reverted to
     a full blocking pipe). Now the behaviour is more in line with
     Unix non-blocking pipes.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) WinNT: Implement accept socket reuse. Using mod_file_cache to
     cache open file handles along with accept socket reuse enables
     Apache 2.0 to serve non-keepalive requests for static files at
     3x the rate of Apache 1.3.(e.g, Apache 1.3 will serve 400 rps
     and Apache 2.0 will serve almost 1200 rps on my system).
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Merge mod_mmap_static function into mod_file_cache. mod_file_cache
     supports two config directives, mmapfile (same behavious as
     mod_mmap_static) and cachefile. Use the cachefile directive
     to cache open file handles. This directive only works on systems
     that have implemented the ap_sendfile API. cachefile works today
     on Windows NT, but has not been tested on any flavors of Unix.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Cleanup the configuration.  With the last few changes the
     configuration process automatically:
         inherits information about how to build from APR.  Allowing
         APR to inform Apache that it should or should not use -ldl
        
         Detects which mod_cgi should be used mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
         based on the threading model

         Apache calls APR's configure process before finishing it's
         configuration processing, allowing for more information flow
         between the two.
     [Ryan Bloom]
         

  *) Change Unix and Win32 ap_setsockopt() so that APR_SO_NONBLOCK
     with non-zero argument makes the socket non-blocking.  BeOS and
     OS/2 already worked this way.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) ap_close() now calls ap_flush() for buffered files, so write
     operations work a whole lot better on buffered files.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix error messages issued from MPMs which explain where to change
     compiled-in limits (e.g., ThreadsPerChild, MaxClients, StartTreads).
     [Greg Ames]

  *) ap_create_pipe() now leaves pipes in blocking state.  (This helps 
     reduce the number of syscalls on Unix.)  ap_set_pipe_timeout() is
     now the way that the blocking state of a pipe is manipulated.
     ap_block_pipe() is gone.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Correct the problem where the only local host name that the IP stack
     can discover are 'undotted' private names.  If no fully qualified
     domain name can be identified, the default ServerName will be set to
     the machine's IP address string. A warning is always provided if the
     ServerName not specified, but assumed.  Solves PR6215 [William Rowe]

  *) Repair problems with config file processing which caused segfault
     at init when virtual hosts were defined and which caused ServerName to
     be ignored when there was no valid DNS setup.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Removed pointless ap_is_aborted macro function. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Add ap_sendfile implementation for AIX
     [Victor J. Orlikowski]

  *) Repair C++ compatibility in ap_config.h, apr_file_io.h, 
     apr_network_io.h, and apr_thread_proc.h.  
     [Tyler J. Brooks <tylerjbrooks home.com>, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Bring the allocation and pool debugging code back into a working
     state.  This will need to be tested as so far it's only been used on
     BeOS. [David Reid]

  *) Change configuration command setup to be properly typesafe when in
     maintainer mode. Note that this requires a compiler that can initialise
     unions. [Ben Laurie]

  *) Turn on buffering for config file reads.  Part of this was to
     repair buffered I/O support in Unix and implement buffered
     ap_fgets() for all platforms.  [Brian Havard, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Fix problem where UTC offset was not being set correctly
     in the access log. Problem reported on news group by Jerry Baker.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix segfault when reporting this type of syntax error:
     "</container> without matching <container> section", where
     container is VirtualHost or Directory or whatever.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) SECURITY: CVE-2000-1204 (cve.mitre.org)
     Prevent the source code for CGIs from being revealed when 
     using mod_vhost_alias and the CGI directory is under the document root
     and a user makes a request like http://www.example.com//cgi-bin/cgi
     as reported in <news:960999105.344321 ernani.logica.co.uk>
     [Tony Finch]

  *) Add support for the new Beos NetwOrking Environment (BONE)
     [David Reid]

  *) xlate: ap_xlate_conv_buffer() now tells the caller when the
     final input char is incomplete; ap_bwrite_xlate() now handles
     incomplete final input chars.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Yet another update to saferead/halfduplex stuff -- need to ensure
     that a bhalfduplex call occurs before logging or else DNS and
     such can delay the last packet of the response.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Some syscall reduction in APR on unix -- don't seek when setting
     up an mmap; and don't fcntl() more than once per socket.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) When mod_cgid is started as root, the cgi daemon now switches 
     to the configured User/Group (like other httpd processes) 
     instead of continuing as root.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) The prefork MPM now uses an APR lock for the accept() mutex.
     It has not been getting a lock at all recently.  httpd -V now 
     displays APR's selection of the lock mechanism instead of the 
     symbols previously respected by prefork.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Change the mmap() feature test to check only for existence.
     The previous check required features not used by Apache.
     [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix a couple of bugs in mod_cgid:  The cgi arguments were
     sometimes mangled.  The len parm to accept() was not 
     initialized, leading sometimes to an endless loop of failed
     accept() calls on OS/390 and anywhere else that failed the call
     if the len was negative.  Use <sys/un.h> for struct sockaddr_un
     instead of declaring it ourselves to fix a compilation problem
     on Solaris.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add Resource limiting code back into Apache 2.0. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix zombie process problem with mod_cgi.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Port mod_mmap_static to 2.0.  Make it go faster.  [Greg Ames]

  *) Fix storage overlay when loading dsos.  Symptom: Apache dies at
     initialization if ALLOC_DEBUG is defined; no known symptom 
     otherwise.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix typo in configure script when checking for mod_so.  bash
     doesn't seem to have a problem but /bin/sh on Solaris does.
     Symptom: "./configure: test: unknown operator =="
     [Jeff Trawick]
   
  *) Rebind the Win32 NT and 9x services control into the MPM.  
     All console, WinNT SCM and Win9x pseudo-service control code is
     now wrapped within the WinNT MPM.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Make a copy of getenv("PATH") before storing for later use.  Some
     getenv() implementations use the same storage for successive calls.
     CGIs on OS/390 had a bad PATH due to this.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Server Tokens work in 2.0 again.  This also propogates the change
     to allow just the product name in the server string using
     PRODUCT_ONLY.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0a4

  *) EBCDIC: Rearrange calls to ap_checkconv() so that most handlers
     won't need to call it.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Move pre_config hook call to between configuration read and config
     tree walk.  This allows all modules to implement pre_config hooks
     and know that they will be called at an appropriate time.
     [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) mod_cgi, mod_cgid: Make ScriptLog directive work again.  
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add pre-config hooks back to all modules.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix a SIGSEGV in ap_md5digest(), which is used when you have
     ContentDigest enabled and we can't/don't mmap the file. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) We now report the correct line number for syntax errors in config
     files.  [Ryan Bloom, Greg Stein, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Brought mod_auth_digest up to synch with 1.3, fixed ap_time_t-
     related bugs, and changed shmem/locking to use apr API. Shared-mem
     is currently disabled, however, because of problems with graceful
     restarts. [Ronald Tschalär]

  *) Fix corruption of IFS variable in --with-module= handling.  
     Depending on the user's shell or customization thereof, there 
     would be errors generating ap_config_auto.h later in the configure
     procedure.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) mod_cgi: Restore logging of stderr from child process when ScriptLog 
     isn't used (as in 1.3), except that on Unix it is now logged via 
     ap_log_rerror() instead of by the child having STDERR_FILENO refer
     to the error log.  [Greg Ames, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add '-D' argument processing for run time configuration defines.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Organize http_main.c as independent code, such that no code or
     global data is exported from it.  WIN32 will dynamically link it
     to the server core, so this will prevent mutual dependency.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add separate dynamic linkage tags APR_EXPORT(), APR_EXPORT_NONSTD()
     and APR_VAR_EXPORT to correctly resolve apr functions and globals.
     [William Rowe]

  *) Add Win9x service execution and Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break/Shutdown handlers.
     [William Rowe, Jan Just Keijser <KEIJSERJJ logica.com>]

  *) Add mod_charset_lite for configuring character set translation.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add '-n' option to htpasswd to make it print its user:pw record
     on stdout rather than having to frob a text file.  [Ken Coar]

  *) Fix saferead.  Basically, we flush the output buffer if a read on the
     input will block.
     [Ryan Bloom]
 
  *) APR: Add ap_xlate_get_sb() so that an app can find out whether or not
     a conversion is single-byte only. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) BEOS: ap_shutdown should return APR_SUCCESS or errno. Note that
     the BeOS 5.0 documentation says that shutdown doesn't work yet.
     [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some minor errors where pid was being manipulated as an int
     instead of the portable pid_t.  [Roy Fielding]

  *) Fix some error log prints that were printing the pointer to a
     structure rather than the pid within the structure.
     [Jeff Trawick, Roy Fielding]

  *) ab: Fix a command-line processing bug; track bad headers in 
     err_response; support reading headers up to 2K. 
     [Ask Bjoern Hansen <ask valueclick.com>]

  *) Fix ap_resolve_env() so that it handles new function added in a prior
     alpha (see "Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the
     config file.") as well as the constructs used by mod_rewrite.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Apache 2.0 builds and runs on OS/390. [Jeff Trawick, Greg Ames]

  *) Change the EBCDIC support in functions for MD5, SHA1, and base 64 to use
     APR to perform translation, instead of accessing the hard-coded tables
     in 1.3's ebcdic.c. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix some bugs (mostly lost 1.3 code) in ab's command-line processing. 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add the ability to hook into the config file reading phase.  Basically
     if a directive is specified EXEC_ON_READ, then when that directive is
     read from the config file, the assocaited function is executed.  This
     should only be used for those directives that must muck with HOW the
     server INTERPRETS the config.  This should not be used for directives
     that re-order or replace items in the config tree.  Those changes should
     be made in the pre-config step.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add mod_example to the build system.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) APR: Add ap_xlate_conv_byte() to convert one char between single-
     byte character sets. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Pick up various EBCDIC fixes from 1.3 (from Martin
     Kraemer and Oliver Reh originally according to the change log).
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a couple of problems in RFC1413 support (controlled by the
     IdentityCheck directive).  Apache did not build the request string
     properly and more importantly Apache would loop forever if the 
     would-be ident server dropped the connection before sending a
     properly terminated response. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apxs works in 2.0.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Reliable piped logs work in 2.0.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Introduce a hash table implementation into APR to be used for
     replacing tables and other random data structures in Apache.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) Add some more error reporting to htpasswd in the case of problems
     generating or accessing the temporary file.  Also, pass in a
     buffer if the implementation knows how to use it (i.e., if L_tmpnam
     is defined).  [Ken Coar]

  *) Configure creates config.nice now containing your configure
     options. Syntax: ./config.nice [--more-options]
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix various return code problems in APR on Win32.  For most of
     these, APR was returning APR_EEXIST instead of GetLastError()/
     WSAGetLastError().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make piped logs work again in version 2.0
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add VPATH support to UNIX build system of Apache and APR.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix ap_tokenize_to_argv to respect the const arguments that are
     passed to it.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix mm's memcpy/memset macros, pointer arithmetic was broken.
     Patch submitted to author.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix mm configuration on Solaris 8 x86 and OS/390.  Don't require
     /sbin in PATH on FreeBSD (all submitted to rse previously) 
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix building Pthread-based MPMs on OpenBSD
     [Sascha Schumann] PR#26

  *) Fix ap_readdir() problem on systems where d_name[] field in
     struct dirent is declared with only one byte.  (This problem only 
     affected multithreaded builds.)  This caused a segfault during
     pool cleanup with mod_autoindex on Solaris (Solaris 8 x86, at 
     least). [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix some make-portability problems on at least Tru64, Irix
     and UnixWare.
     [Sascha Schumann] PR#18, PR#39

  *) Add ap_sigwait() to support old-style sigwait() on systems
     like OS/390 and UnixWare.
     [Sascha Schumann] 

  *) Add POSIX-thread flags for more platforms.
     [Sascha Schumann]

  *) Fix some minor bugs in ap_strerror().  Teach ap_strerror()
     (on Unix, at least) to handle resolver errors.  Fix a bug in
     the definition of APR_ENOMEM so that ap_strerror() can spit
     out the correct error message for it.
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a3

  *) mod_so reports ap_os_dso_error() if ap_dso_load() fails
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) API: *HOOK* macros now have an AP_ prefix
     [Doug MacEachern]

  *) Win32: Eliminate redundant calls to initialize winsock.
     [Tim Costello <timcostello ozemail.com.au>]

  *) Fix bugs initializing ungetchar for pipes. 
     [Chia-liang Kao <clkao CirX.ORG>]

  *) The ab program in the src/support directory is now portable using
     APR.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Support directory is being compiled when the server is built
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) The configure option --with-program-name has been added to allow
     developers to rename the executable at configure time.  This also
     changes the name of the config files to match the executable's name.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_autoindex: Add `IndexOptions +VersionSort', to nicely sort filenames
     containing version numbers. [Martin Pool]

  *) ap_open(..,APR_OS_DEFAULT,..) uses perms 0666 instead of 0777 on
     Unix; access_log and error_log now created with these perms; non-
     Unix is unaffected [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Finished move of ap_md5 routines to apr_md5.  Removed ap_md5.h.
     Replaced more magic numbers with MD5_DIGESTSIZE.
     [William Rowe, Roy Fielding]

  *) Win32: Get mod_auth_digest compiling and added to the Windows
     build environment. Not tested and I'd be suprised if it 
     actually works. [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Revamp the Win32 make environment. Makefiles have been removed and
     Apache.dsw created to bring together all the pieces. Create new file
     os/win32/BaseAddr.ref to define module base addresses (to prevent
     dll relocation at start-up).
     [William Rowe, Greg Marr, Tim Costello, Bill Stoddard]

  *) [EBCDIC] Port Paul Gilmartin's CRLF patch from 1.3.  This replaces most
     of the \015, \012, and \015\012 constants with macros.
     [Greg Ames]
     
  *) Add ap_xlate_open() et al for translation of text between different 
     character sets.  The initial implementation requires iconv().
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) More FAQs and answers from comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix.
     [Joshua Slive <slive finance.commerce.ubc.ca>]

  *) CGI output is being timed out now.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Fix the problem with dieing quietly.  dupfile now takes a pool which
     is used by the new apr file.  There is no reason to create a new file
     with the same lifetime as the original file.
     [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) Win32: Attempt to eliminate dll relocation at start-up by specifying
     module base addresses. This will help shooting seg faults
     in the field. [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) Update Apache on Windows documentation. Add new document
     describing how to compile Apache on Windows.
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) ap_set_pipe_timeout(), ap_poll(), and APR_SO_TIMEOUT now take 
     microseconds instead of seconds.  Some storage leaks and other
     minor bugs in related code were fixed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: First cut at getting mod_isapi working under 2.0
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) First stab at getting mod_auth_digest working under 2.0
     quick change summary:
     - moved the random byte generation (ap_generate_random_bytes) into APR
     - now uses ap_time_t
     - compiles and runs on linux
     - tested with amaya
     [Brian Martin <bmartin penguincomputing.com>]

  *) Win32: Move the space stripping of physical service names
     fix up from Apache 1.3. #include'ing "ap_mpm.h" fixes up an
     unresolved symbol. Add dependency checking to the
     CreateService call to ensure TCPIP and AFP (winsock) is started
     before Apache.
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) Win32: Add code to perform latebinding on functions that may
     not exist on all levels of Windows where Apache runs. This
     is needed to allow Apache to start-up on Win95/98. All calls
     to non portable functions should be protected with
     ap_oslevel checks to prevent runtime segfaults. 
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) Fix fallback default values for SHM_R and SHM_W [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Get lingering_close() working again. [Dean Gaudet, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Win32: Get non-blocking CGI pipe reads working under Windows NT.
     This addresses PR 1623. Still need to address timing out runaway
     CGI scripts. [Bill Stoddard]
 
  *) Win32: Make ap_stat Windows 95/98 friendly
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]                                            

  *) Win32: Fix a bug in ap_get_oslevel which causes GetVersionEx() to 
     always fail. Need to initialise the dwOSVersionInfoSize member of the 
     OSVERSIONINFO struct before calling GetVersionEx, so GetVersionEx 
     always fails. 

     The patch also enhances ap_get_oslevel (and the associated enum) to 
     handle selected service packs for NT4, and adds recognition for 
     Windows 2000. This is useful, eg. if we can recognise NT4 SP2 then 
     we can use ReadFileScatter and WriteFileGather in readwrite.c. 
     [Tim Costello <Tim.Costello BTFinancialgroup.com>]

  *) Get mod_rewrite building and running, and mod_status building for Win NT
     [Allan Edwards <ake raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Patch to port mod_auth_db to the 2.0 api and also to support 
     Berlekey DB 3.0. It works for me with both Berkeley DB 3.0.55 and 
     2.7.7.  It should work with version 1 as well but I haven't tested it.  
     [Brian Martin <bmartin penguincomputing.com>]

  *) Get APR DSO code working under Windows. Includes cross platform
     fixes to mod_so.c.
     [<Tim.Costello BTFinancialgroup.com>]

  *) Fix some of the Windows APR time functions.
     [William Rowe]

  *) FAQ changes related to tidying up historical documents on the web site.
     [Joshua Slive <slive finance.commerce.ubc.ca>]

  *) Move Windows DSO code into APR.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Eliminate apr_win.h and apr_winconfig.h (and the ugly #ifdefs they cause).
     Now, apr.h and apr_config.h are generated from apr.hw and apr_config.hw
     at build time. At this point, the server will not compile on Windows because
     of the recent DSO commits. Fixing those next.
     [Bill Rowe & Bill Stoddard]

  *) Added error checking for file I/O APR routines.
     [Jon Travis <jtravis covalent.net>]

  *) APR: Don't use the values of resolver error codes for the 
     corresponding APR error codes.  On Unix and Win32, return the 
     proper APR error code after a resolver error. [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with Apache 2.0a2

  *) Renamed the executable back to httpd on all platforms other 
     than Win32
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Allow BeOS to survive restarts, log properly and a few
     small things it had problems with due to the way it setup
     users and groups. [David Reid]

  *) Get mod_rewrite working with APR locks
     [Paul Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Actually remove the sempahore when the lock cleanup routine
     is called on BeOS. [David Reid]

  *) Clear hook registrations between reads of the config file.
     When DSOs are unloaded and re-loaded the old hook pointers may
     no longer be valid. This fix eliminates potential segfaults.
     [Allan Edwards <ake raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) Fix a problem with Sigfunc not being defined or bypassed
     if sigaction() wasn't found. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Fix the locking mechanism on BSD variants.  They now use fcntl
     locks.  This allows the server to start and serve pages.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) First cut at getting the Win32 installer to work
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) Get htpasswd compiling under Windows
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>]

  *) Change the log message for a bind() failure to show the
     interface and port number. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Import the documentation from 1.3.12 and bring parts of it
     up-to-date with respect to the changes that have occurred
     in 2.0.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) BeOS MPM updated.  CGI bug on BeOS fixed.  IP addresses
     now logged correctly on BeOS.
     [David Reid]

  *) Create one makefile for all Win32 distributions (NT/2000/95/98).
     Makefile.win includes the same user interface as the old 
     Makefile.nt 
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>, Jeff Trawick <trawick us.ibm.com>]

  *) Win32 exec now uses COMSPEC environment string for command 
     shell path resolution.
     [William Rowe <wrowe lnd.com>] PR#3715

  *) Win32: ap_connect() was not returning correct error condition
     PR5866
     [Allen Prescott <allen clanprescott.com>]

  *) Win32: ap_open() was broken on Win9x because an NT-specific
     flag was passed to CreateFile.  ap_puts() added an unnecessary
     '\n'.
     [Jeff Trawick <trawick us.ibm.com>]

  *) Put in Korean and Norwegian index.html pages (2.0 and 1.3)
     which where donated by Lee Kuk Hyun and Lorant Czaran. 'Fixed'
     confusing ee/et name and made all extensions language/dialect
     rather than country reflecting. Changed example files to
     explicit reflect the ISO charset and added a few common 
     ones to the example config [dirkx]

  *) Extend external module capability.  To use this, you call
     configure with --with-module=path/to/mod1,path/to/mod2,etc.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Backported the various "default charset" fixes from 1.3.12,
     including the AddDefaultCharset directive. [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Added the capability to do ${ENVVAR} constructs in the
     config file. E.g. 'ServerAdmin ${POSTMASTER}'. As commited
     it does this on a line by line basis; i.e. if the envvar
     expands to something with spaces you have to protect it
     by adding quotes around it (Unless of course you expect it
     to contains more than one argument. Alternatively you
     can compile it on a per token basis; which is what people
     usually expect by setting RESOLVE_ENV_PER_TOKEN. But this
     hampers fancier hacks.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Changed the 'ErrorDocument' syntax in that it NO longer
     supports the asymetric

                ErrorDocument 301 "Some message

     Note the opening " quote, without a closing quote. It now
     has either the following syntaxes

                ErrorDocument XXX /local/uri
                ErrorDocument XXX http://valid/url
                ErrorDocument XXX "Some Message"

     The recognition heuristic is: if it has a space it
     is a message. If it has no spaces and starts with a /
     or is a valid URL then treat it that way. Otherwise it
     is assumed to be a message.

     This breaks backward compatibility but makes live a hell
     of a lot easier for GUI's and config file parsers.
     [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Changed 'CacheNegotiatedDocs' from its present/not-present
     syntax into a 'on' or 'off' syntax. As it currently is the
     only non nesting token which uses NO_ARGS and thus is an
     absolute pain for any config interface automation. This
     breaks backward compatibility. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

  *) Add ability to add external modules to the build process.  This is
     done with --with-module=/path/to/module.  Modules can only be added
     as static modules at this point.
     [Ryan Bloom]

Changes with Apache 2.0a1

  *) Fix FreeBSD 3.3 core dump.
     Basically, ap_initialize() needs to get called before 
     create_process(), since create_process() passes op_on structure
     to semop() to get a lock, but op_on isn't initialized until 
     ap_initialize() calls setup_lock().  Here is a slight
     rearrangement to main() which calls ap_initialize() earlier...
     [Jeff Trawick <trawick us.ibm.com>]

  *) Enable Apache to use sendfile/TransmitFile API
     [Bill Stoddard, David Reid, Paul Reder]

  *) Re-Implement Win32 APR network I/O APIs and most of the file I/O
     APIs.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Make file I/O and network I/O writev/sendv APIs consistent.
     Eliminate use of ap_iovec_t and use Posix struct iovec.
     Use seperate variable on ap_writev to set the number of iovecs
     passed in and number of bytes written.
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Adapt file iol to use APR functions. Replaced ap_open_file() 
     with ap_create_file_iol(). ap_create_file_iol() requires that 
     the file be opened prior to the call using ap_open().
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Port mod_include and mod_cgi to 2.0
     [Paul Reder, Bill Stoddard]

  *) ap_send{,v}, ap_recv, ap_sendfile API clarification --
     bytes_read/bytes_written is always valid (never -1).  Plus
     some fixes to buff.c to correct problems introduced by the
     errno => ap_status_t changes a while back.  Plus a fix to
     chunked encoding introduced right at the beginning of 2.0.
     [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Revamped UNIX build system to use autoconf and libtool.
     [Manoj Kasichainula, Sascha Schumann]

  *) port mod_rewrite to 2.0. [Paul J. Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) SECURITY: More rigorous checking of Host: headers to fix security 
     problems with mass name-based virtual hosting (whether using mod_rewrite
     or mod_vhost_alias).
     [Ben Hyde, Tony Finch]
  
  *) Add back support for UseCanonicalName in <Directory> containers.
     [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Added APLOG_STARTUP log type.  This allows us to write an error
     message without any of the date and time information.  As a part
     of this change, I also removed all of the calls to fprintf(stderr
     and replaced them with calls to ap_log_error using APLOG_STARTUP
     writing to stderr is no longer portable, because we don't direct 
     stderr to the error log on all platforms.
     [Ryan Bloom] 
 
  *) Convert error logging functions to take errno as an argument.
     This makes our error logs more portable, because some Windows API's 
     don't set errno.  This change allows us to still output a valid
     message on all of our platforms.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) mod_mime_magic runs in 2.0-dev now.
     [Paul Reder <rederpj raleigh.ibm.com>]

  *) sendfile has been added to APR.
     [John Zedlewski <zedlwski Princeton.EDU>]

  *) buff.c has been converted to no longer use errno.
     [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) mod_speling runs in 2.0-dev now: a bug in readdir_r handling and
     interface adaption to APR functions did it. [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Support DSOs properly on 32-bit HP-UX 11.0
     [Dilip Khandekar <dilip cup.hp.com>]

  *) Updated MM in APR source tree from version 1.0.8 to 1.0.11
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Cleaned APR build environment integration and bootstrap APR 
     automatically for developers from src/Configure.
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Fixed building of src/support/htpasswd.c
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) When generating the Location: header, mod_speling forgot
     to escape the spelling-fixed uri. (Forw-Port from 1.3)
     [Martin Kraemer]

  *) Moved mod_auth_digest.c from experimental to standard. [Roy Fielding]

  *) Change all pools to APR contexts.  This is the first step to
     incorporating APR into Apache. [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Move "handler not found" warning message to below the check
     for a wildcard handler.  [Dirk <dirkm teleport.com>, Roy Fielding]
     PR#2584, PR#2751, PR#3349, PR#3436, PR#3548, PR#4384, PR#4795, PR#4807

  *) Support line-continuation feature in config.option file and
     allow the loading of multiple option sections at once via
     ``--with-option=<section1>,<section2>,...''
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) Rebuilt CVS repository with Apache 1.3.9 as basis.  [Roy Fielding]

Changes with Apache MPM

  *) Use asynchronous AcceptEx() and a completion port to accept and
     dispatch connections to threads in Windows NT/2000. 
     [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Implement WINNT Win32 MPM from original Win32 code in http_main.c
     [Bill Stoddard]  

  *) Implement the APACI --with-option facility 
     (per default used the config.option file).
     [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  *) MPM BEOS port.  [David Reid <abb37 dial.pipex.com>]

  *) Start to implement module-defined hooks that are a) fast and b) typesafe.
     Replace pre_connection module call with a register_hook call and
     implement pre_connection as a hook. The intent is that these hooks will
     be extended to allow Apache to be multi-protocol, and also to allow the
     calling order to be specified on a per-hook/per-module basis.
     [Ben Laurie]

  *) Implement mpm_* methods as "modules". Each method gets its own
     subdir in src/modules (eg: src/modules/prefork). Selection
     of method uses Rule MPM_METHOD.  [Jim Jagielski]

  *) Port the hybrid server from the apache-apr repository as
     mpm_mpmt_pthread.  [Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) os/unix/unixd.[ch]: detach, setuid, setgid, stuff which will be common
     amongst the unix MPMs.

  *) mpm_prefork: throw away all the alarm/timeout crud; and clean up the
     signal handling for the new world order.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Crude ap_thread_mutex abstraction so that we get the pthread stuff out
     of alloc.c for now.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Handle partial large writes correctly.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Eliminate conn_rec's pointer to server. All it knows is the base server
     based on IP/port.  [Ben Laurie]

  *) Port a bunch of modules to the new module structure.
     ["Michael H. Voase" <mvoase midcoast.com.au>]

  *) I/O layering and BUFF revamp.  See docs/buff.txt.  [Dean Gaudet]

  *) Basic restructuring to introduce the MPM concept; includes various
     changes to the module API... better described by
     docs/initial_blurb.txt.  [Dean Gaudet]

Changes with Apache pthreads

  *) New buff option added: BO_TIMEOUT. It describes the timeout for
     buff operations (generally over a network).
     [Dean Gaudet, Ryan Bloom, Manoj Kasichainula]

  *) Created http_accept abstraction. Added 4 new functions (not exported):
     init_accept(), begin_accepting_requests(), get_request(), 
     stop_accepting_requests() [Bill Stoddard]

  *) Fix to ap_rprintf call that allows mod_info to work properly.
     [James Morris <jmorris intercode.com.au>]

  *) user and ap_auth_type fields were moved from connection_rec to 
     request_rec. [Ryan Bloom] 

  *) Removed the ap_block_alarms and ap_unblock_alarm calls.  These aren't
     needed in a threaded server.

  *) Initial pthread implementation from from Dean's apache-nspr code.
     [Bill Stoddard, Ryan Bloom]
